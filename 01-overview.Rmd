# Overview {#overview}

## Aims

This module aims to provides students with a range of techniques for analysing and modelling spatial data:

* build upon the more general research training delivered via companion modules on *Data Collection and Data Analysis*, both of which have an aspatial focus;
* highlight a number of key social issues that have a spatial dimension;
* explain the specific challenges faced when attempting to analyse spatial data;
* introduce a range of analytical techniques and approaches suitable for the analysis of spatial data; and,
* enhance practical skills in using *R* software packages to implement a wide range of spatial analytical tools.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, students should be able to:

* identify some key sources of spatial data and resources of spatial analysis and modelling tools;
* explain the advantages of taking spatial structure into account when analysing spatial data;
* apply a range of computer-based techniques for the analysis of spatial data, including mapping, correlation, kernel density estimation, regression, multi-level models, geographically-weighted regression, spatial interaction models and spatial econometrics;
* apply appropriate analytical strategies to tackle the key methodological challenges facing spatial analysis â€“ spatial autocorrelation, heterogeneity, and ecological fallacy; and, 
* select appropriate analytical tools for analysing specific spatial data sets to address emerging social issues facing the society.
