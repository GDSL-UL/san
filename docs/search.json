    "text": "1.5 Assessment\nThe final module mark is composed of the two computational essays. Together they are designed to cover the materials introduced in the entirety of content covered during the semester. A computational essay is an essay whose narrative is supported by code and computational results that are included in the essay itself. Each teaching week, you will be required to address a set of questions relating to the module content covered in that week, and to use the material that you will produce for this purpose to build your computational essay.\nAssignment 1 (50%) refer to the set of questions at the end of Chapter 4, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6. You are required to use your responses to build your computational essay. Each chapter provides more specific guidance of the tasks and discussion that you are required to consider in your assignment.\nAssignment 2 (50%) refer to the set of questions at the end of Chapter 7, Chapter 8, Chapter 9 and Chapter 10. You are required to use your responses to build your computational essay. Each chapter provides more specific guidance of the tasks and discussion that you are required to consider in your assignment.\n\n1.5.1 Format Requirements\nBoth assignments will have the same requirements:\n\nMaximum word count: 2,000 words, excluding figures and references.\nUp to three maps, plot or figures (a figure may include more than one map and/or plot and will only count as one but needs to be integrated in the figure)\nUp to two tables.\n\nAssignments need to be prepared in “Quarto Document” format (i.e. qmd extension) and then converted into a self-contained HTML file that will then be submitted via Turnitin. The document should only display content that will be assessed. Intermediate steps do not need to be displayed. Messages resulting from loading packages, attaching data frames, or similar messages do not need to be included as output code. Useful resources to customise your R notebook can be found on Quarto’s website.\nTwo Quarto Document templates will be available via the module Canvas site.\nSubmission is electronic only via Turnitin on Canvas.\n\n1.5.2 Marking criteria\nThe Standard Environmental Sciences School marking criteria apply, with a stronger emphasis on evidencing the use of regression models, critical analysis of results and presentation standards. In addition to these general criteria, the code and outputs (i.e. tables, maps and plots) contained within the notebook submitted for assessment will be assessed according to the extent of documentation and evidence of expertise in changing and extending the code options illustrated in each chapter. Specifically, the following criteria will be applied:\n\n\n0-15: no documentation and use of default options.\n\n16-39: little documentation and use of default options.\n\n40-49: some documentation, and use of default options.\n\n50-59: extensive documentation, and edit of some of the options provided in the notebook (e.g. change north arrow location).\n\n60-69: extensive well organised and easy to read documentation, and evidence of understanding of options provided in the code (e.g. tweaking existing options).\n\n70-79: all above, plus clear evidence of code design skills (e.g. customising graphics, combining plots (or tables) into a single output, adding clear axis labels and variable names on graphic outputs, etc.).\n\n80-100: all as above, plus code containing novel contributions that extend/improve the functionality the code was provided with (e.g. comparative model assessments, novel methods to perform the task, etc.).",

    "text": "2.1 Spatial Data types\nDifferent classifications of spatial data types exist. Knowing the structure of the data at hand is important as specific analytical methods would be more appropriate for particular data types. We will use a particular classification involving four data types: lattice/areal data, point data, flow data and trajectory data (Fig. 1). This is not a exhaustive list but it is helpful to motivate the analytical and modelling methods that we cover in this book.\nLattice/Areal Data. These data correspond to records of attribute values (such as population counts) for a fixed geographical area. They may comprise regular shapes (such as grids or pixels) or irregular shapes (such as states, counties or travel-to-work areas). Raster data are a common source of regular lattice/areal area, while censuses are probably the most common form of irregular lattice/areal area. Point data within an area can be aggregated to produce lattice/areal data.\nPoint Data. These data refer to records of the geographic location of an discrete event, or the number of occurrences of geographical process at a given location. As displayed in Fig. 1, examples include the geographic location of bus stops in a city, or the number of boarding passengers at each bus stop.\nFlow Data. These data refer to records of measurements for a pair of geographic point locations. or pair of areas. These data capture the linkage or spatial interaction between two locations. Migration flows between a place of origin and a place of destination is an example of this type of data.\nTrajectory Data. These data record geographic locations of moving objects at various points in time. A trajectory is composed of a single string of data recording the geographic location of an object at various points in time and each record in the string contains a time stamp. These data are complex and can be classified into explicit trajectory data and implicit trajectory data. The former refer to well-structured data and record positions of objects continuously and intensively at uniform time intervals, such as GPS data. The latter is less structured and record data in relatively time point intervals, including sensor-based, network-based and signal-based data (Kong et al. 2018).\nIn this course, we cover analytical and modelling approaches for point, lattice/areal and flow data. While we do not explicitly analyse trajectory data, various of the analytical approaches described in this book can be extended to incorporate time, and can be applied to model these types of data. In Chapter 10, we describe approaches to analyse and model spatio-temporal data. These same methods can be applied to trajectory data.",

You can find the hierarchical representation of UK Statistical Geographies on the Office for National Statistics website. In the bottom part of the output below, we can observe a spatial data frame for Liverpool displaying the hierarchical structure of census data (from the smallest to the largest): Output Areas (OAs), Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs), Middle Super Output Areas (MSOAs) and Local Authority Districts (LADs).

    "section": "\n2.3 Key Challenges",
    "text": "2.3 Key Challenges\nMajor challenges exist when working with spatial data. Below we explore some of the key longstanding problems data scientists often face when working with geographical data.\n\n2.3.1 Modifible Area Unit Problem (MAUP)\nThe Modifible Area Unit Problem (MAUP) represents a challenge that has troubled geographers for decades (Openshaw 1981). Two aspects of the MAUP are normally recognised in empirical analysis relating to scale and zonation. Fig. 2 illustrates these issues\n\nScale refers to the idea that a geographical area can be divided into geographies with differing numbers of spatial units.\nZonation refers to the idea that a geographical area can be divided into the same number of units in a variety of ways.\n\n\n\nFig. 2. MAUP effect. (a) scale effect; and, (b) zonation effect. Source: Loidl et al. (2016).\n\nThe MAUP is a critical issue as it can impact our analysis and thus any conclusions we can infer from our results (e.g. Fotheringham and Wong 1991). There is no agreed systematic approach on how to handle the effects of the MAUP. Some have suggested to perform analyses based on different existing geographical scales, and assess the consistency of the results and identify potential sources of change. The issue with such approach is that results from analysis at different scales are likely to differ because distinct dimensions of a geographic process may be captured at different scales. For example, in migration studies, smaller geographies may be more suitable to capture residential mobility over short distances, while large geographies may be more suitable to capture long-distance migration. And it is well documented that these types of moves are driven by different factors. While residential mobility tends to be driven by housing related reasons, long-distance migration is more closely related to employment-related motives (Niedomysl 2011).\nAn alternative approach is to use the smallest geographical system available and create random aggregations at various geographical scales, to directly quantify the extent of scale and zonation. This approach has shown promising results in applications to study internal migration flows (Stillwell, Daras, and Bell 2018). Another approach involves the production of “meaningful” or functional geographies that can more appropriately capture the process of interest. There is an active area of work defining functional labour markets (Casado-Díaz, Martínez-Bernabéu, and Rowe 2017), urban areas (Arribas-Bel, Garcia-López, and Viladecans-Marsal 2021) and various forms of geodemographic classifications (Singleton and Spielman 2013; Patias, Rowe, and Cavazzi 2019) . However there is the recognition that none of the existing approaches resolve the effects of the MAUP and recently it has been suggested that the most plausible ‘solution’ would be to ignore the MAUP (Wolf et al. 2020).\n\n2.3.2 Ecological Fallacy\nEcological fallacy is an error in the interpretation of statistical data based on aggregate information. Specifically it refers to inferences made about the nature of specific individuals based solely on statistics aggregated for a given group. It is about thinking that relationships observed for groups necessarily hold for individuals. A key example is Robinson (1950) who illustrates this problem exploring the difference between ecological correlations and individual correlations. He looked at the relationship between country of birth and literacy. Robinson (1950) used the percent of foreign-born population and percent of literate population for the 48 states in the United States in 1930. The ecological correlation based on these data was 0.53. This suggests a positive association between foreign birth and literacy, and could be interpreted as foreign born individuals being more likely to be literate than native-born individuals. Yet, the correlation based on individual data was negative -0.11 which indicates the opposite. The main point emerging from this example is to carefully interpret analysis based on spatial data and avoid making inferences about individuals from these data.\n\n2.3.3 Spatial Dependence\nSpatial dependence refers to the spatial relationship of a variable’s values for a pair of locations at a certain distance apart, so that these values are more similar (or less similar) than expected for randomly associated pairs of observations (Anselin 1988). For example, we could think of observed patterns of ethnic segregation in an area are a result of spillover effects of pre-existing patterns of ethnic segregation in neighbouring areas. Chapter 5 will illustrate approach to explicitly incorporate spatial dependence in regression analysis.\n\n2.3.4 Spatial Heterogeneity\nSpatial heterogeneity refers to the uneven distribution of a variable’s values across space. Concentration of deprivation or unemployment across an area are good examples of spatial heterogeneity. We illustrate various ways to visualise, explore and measure the spatial distribution of data in multiple chapters. We also discuss on potential modelling approaches to capture spatial heterogeneity in Chapter 5, Chapter 7 and Chapter 10.\n\n2.3.5 Spatial nonstationarity\nSpatial nonstationarity refers to variations in the relationship between an outcome variable and a set of predictor variables across space. In a modelling context, it relates to a situation in which a simple “global” model is inappropriate to explain the relationships between a set of variables. The geographical nature of the model must be modified to reflect local structural relationships within the data. For example, ethinic segregation has been positively associated with employment outcomes in some countries pointing to networks in pre-existing communities facilitating access to the local labour market. Inversely ethinic segregation has been negatively associated with employment outcomes pointing to lack of integration into the broader local community. We illustrate various modelling approaches to capture spatial nonstationarity in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnselin, Luc. 1988. Spatial Econometrics: Methods and Models. Vol. 4.

    "text": "3.2 Introducing R\nR is a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques. It has gained widespread use in academia and industry. R offers a wider array of functionality than a traditional statistics package, such as SPSS and is composed of core (base) functionality, and is expandable through libraries hosted on The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.\nCommands are sent to R using either the terminal / command line or the R Console which is installed with R on either Windows or OS X. On Linux, there is no equivalent of the console, however, third party solutions exist. On your own machine, R can be installed from here.\nNormally RStudio is used to implement R coding. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R and provides a more user-friendly front-end to R than the front-end provided with R.\nTo run R or RStudio, just double click on the R or RStudio icon. Throughout this module, we will be using RStudio:\n\n\nFig. 1. RStudio features.\n\nIf you would like to know more about the various features of RStudio, watch this video",

An R script is just a plain text file with R commands in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo get familiar with good practices in writing your code in R, we recommend the Chapter Workflow: basics and Workflow: scripts and projects from the R in Data Science book by Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023).\n\n\nhttps://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-basics.html\nTo create an R script in RStudio, you need to\n\nOpen a new script file: File &gt; New File &gt; R Script\nWrite some code on your new script window by typing eg. mtcars\nRun the script. Click anywhere on the line of code, then hit Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Cmd + Enter (Mac) to run the command or select the code chunk and click run on the right-top corner of your script window.

A Quarto Document is an improved version of the original R Notebook. Quarto Document requires a package called Quarto. Quarto does not have a dependency or requirement for R. Quarto is multilingual, beginning with R, Python, Javascript, and Julia. The concept is that Quarto will work even for languages that do not yet exist. This book was original written in R Notebook but later transitioned into Quarto Documents.\nTo create an R Notebook, you need to:\n\nOpen a new script file: File &gt; New File &gt; R Notebook\n\n\n\n\nFig. 2. YAML metadata for notebooks.\n\n\nInsert code chunks, either:\n\n\nuse the Insert command on the editor toolbar;\nuse the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + I or Cmd + Option + I (Mac); or,\ntype the chunk delimiters ```{r} and ```\n\n\nIn a chunk code you can produce text output, tables, graphics and write code! You can control these outputs via chunk options which are provided inside the curly brackets e.g.:\n\n\nFig. 3. Code chunk example. Details on the various options: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html\n\n\nExecute code: hit “Run Current Chunk”, Ctrl + Shift + Enter or Cmd + Shift + Enter (Mac)\nSave an R notebook: File &gt; Save As. A notebook has a *.Rmd extension and when it is saved a *.nb.html file is automatically created. The latter is a self-contained HTML file which contains both a rendered copy of the notebook with all current chunk outputs and a copy of the *.Rmd file itself.\n\nRstudio also offers a Preview option on the toolbar which can be used to create pdf, html and word versions of the notebook. To do this, choose from the drop-down list menu knit to ...\nTo create a Quarto Document, you need to:\n\nOpen a new script file: File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document\n\n\nQuarto Documents work in the same way as R Notebooks with small variations.

    "section": "\n3.6 Variables and objects",
    "text": "3.6 Variables and objects\nAn object is a data structure having attributes and methods. In fact, everything in R is an object!\nA variable is a type of data object. Data objects also include list, vector, matrices and text.\n\nCreating a data object\n\nIn R a variable can be created by using the symbol &lt;- to assign a value to a variable name. The variable name is entered on the left &lt;- and the value on the right. Note: Data objects can be given any name, provided that they start with a letter of the alphabet, and include only letters of the alphabet, numbers and the characters . and _. Hence AgeGroup, Age_Group and Age.Group are all valid names for an R data object. Note also that R is case-sensitive, to agegroup and AgeGroup would be treated as different data objects.\nTo save the value 28 to a variable (data object) labelled age, run the code:\n\nage &lt;- 28\n\n\nInspecting a data object\n\nTo inspect the contents of the data object age run the following line of code:\n\nage\n\n[1] 28\n\n\nFind out what kind (class) of data object age is using:\n\nclass(age) \n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nInspect the structure of the age data object:\n\nstr(age) \n\n num 28\n\n\n\nThe vector data object\n\nWhat if we have more than one response? We can use the c( ) function to combine multiple values into one data vector object:\n\nage &lt;- c(28, 36, 25, 24, 32)\nage\n\n[1] 28 36 25 24 32\n\nclass(age) #Still numeric..\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nstr(age) #..but now a vector (set) of 5 separate values\n\n num [1:5] 28 36 25 24 32\n\n\nNote that on each line in the code above any text following the # character is ignored by R when executing the code. Instead, text following a # can be used to add comments to the code to make clear what the code is doing. Two marks of good code are a clear layout and clear commentary on the code.\n\n3.6.1 Basic Data Types\nThere are a number of data types. Four are the most common. In R, numeric is the default type for numbers. It stores all numbers as floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals). This is because most statistical calculations deal with numbers with up to two decimals.\n\nNumeric\n\n\nnum &lt;- 4.5 # Decimal values\nclass(num)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\nInteger\n\n\nint &lt;- as.integer(4) # Natural numbers. Note integers are also numerics.\nclass(int)\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\n\nCharacter\n\n\ncha &lt;- \"are you enjoying this?\" # text or string. You can also type `as.character(\"are you enjoying this?\")`\nclass(cha)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\nLogical\n\n\nlog &lt;- 2 &lt; 1 # assigns TRUE or FALSE. In this case, FALSE as 2 is greater than 1\nlog\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nclass(log)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Random Variables\nIn statistics, we differentiate between data to capture:\n\n\nQualitative attributes categorise objects eg.gender, marital status. To measure these attributes, we use Categorical data which can be divided into:\n\n\nNominal data in categories that have no inherent order eg. gender\n\nOrdinal data in categories that have an inherent order eg. income bands\n\n\n\nQuantitative attributes:\n\n\nDiscrete data: count objects of a certain category eg. number of kids, cars\n\nContinuous data: precise numeric measures eg. weight, income, length.\n\n\n\nIn R these three types of random variables are represented by the following types of R data object:\n\n\n\n\nvariables\nobjects\n\n\n\nnominal\nfactor\n\n\nordinal\nordered factor\n\n\ndiscrete\nnumeric\n\n\ncontinuous\nnumeric\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have already encountered the R data type numeric. The next section introduces the factor data type.\n\n3.6.2.1 Factor\nWhat is a factor?\nA factor variable assigns a numeric code to each possible category (level) in a variable. Behind the scenes, R stores the variable using these numeric codes to save space and speed up computing. For example, compare the size of a list of 10,000 males and females to a list of 10,000 1s and 0s. At the same time R also saves the category names associated with each numeric code (level). These are used for display purposes.\nFor example, the variable gender, converted to a factor, would be stored as a series of 1s and 2s, where 1 = female and 2 = male; but would be displayed in all outputs using their category labels of female and male.\nCreating a factor\nTo convert a numeric or character vector into a factor use the factor( ) function. For instance:\n\ngender &lt;- c(\"female\",\"male\",\"male\",\"female\",\"female\") # create a gender variable\ngender &lt;- factor(gender) # replace character vector with a factor version\ngender\n\n[1] female male   male   female female\nLevels: female male\n\nclass(gender)\n\n[1] \"factor\"\n\nstr(gender)\n\n Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 1 2 2 1 1\n\n\nNow gender is a factor and is stored as a series of 1s and 2s, with 1s representing females and 2s representing males. The function levels( ) lists the levels (categories) associated with a given factor variable:\n\nlevels(gender)\n\n[1] \"female\" \"male\"  \n\n\nThe categories are reported in the order that they have been numbered (starting from 1). Hence from the output we can infer that females are coded as 1, and males as 2.",

Hence it is worth spending some time understanding how to reference dataframes.\nThe relevant R function, [ ], has the format [row,col] or, more generally, [set of rows, set of cols].\nRun the following commands to get a feel of how to extract different slices of the data:\n\ndf # whole data.frame\ndf[1, 1] # contents of first row and column\ndf[2, 2:3] # contents of the second row, second and third columns\ndf[1, ] # first row, ALL columns [the default if no columns specified]\ndf[ ,1:2] # ALL rows; first and second columns\ndf[c(1,3,5), ] # rows 1,3,5; ALL columns\ndf[ , 2] # ALL rows; second column (by default results containing only \n             #one column are converted back into a vector)\ndf[ , 2, drop=FALSE] # ALL rows; second column (returned as a data.frame)\n\nIn the above, note that we have used two other R functions:\n\n1:3 The colon operator tells R to produce a list of numbers including the named start and end points.\nc(1,3,5) Tells R to combine the contents within the brackets into one list of objects\n\nRun both of these fuctions on their own to get a better understanding of what they do.\nThree other methods for referencing the contents of a data.frame make direct use of the variable names within the data.frame, which tends to make for easier to read/understand code:\n\ndf[,\"pop\"] # variable name in quotes inside the square brackets\ndf$pop # variable name prefixed with $ and appended to the data.frame name\n# or you can use attach\nattach(df)\npop # but be careful if you already have an age variable in your local workspace\n\nWant to check the variables available, use the names( ):\n\nnames(df)\n\n[1] \"wards\"   \"pop\"     \"ghealth\"",

    "section": "\n3.9 Manipulation Data",
    "text": "3.9 Manipulation Data\n\n3.9.1 Adding New Variables\nUsually you want to add / create new variables to your data frame using existing variables eg. computing percentages by dividing two variables. There are many ways in which you can do this i.e. referecing a data frame as we have done above, or using $ (e.g. census$pop). For this module, we’ll use tidyverse:\n\ncensus &lt;- census %&gt;% \n  mutate( per_ghealth = ghealth / pop )\n\nNote we used a pipe operator %&gt;%, which helps make the code more efficient and readable - more details, see Grolemund and Wickham (2019). When using the pipe operator, recall to first indicate the data frame before %&gt;%.\nNote also the use a variable name before the = sign in brackets to indicate the name of the new variable after mutate.\n\n3.9.2 Selecting Variables\nUsually you want to select a subset of variables for your analysis as storing to large data sets in your R memory can reduce the processing speed of your machine. A selection of data can be achieved by using the select function:\n\nndf &lt;- census %&gt;% \n  select( ward, pop16_74, per_ghealth )\n\nAgain first indicate the data frame and then the variable you want to select to build a new data frame. Note the code chunk above has created a new data frame called ndf. Explore it.\n\n3.9.3 Filtering Data\nYou may also want to filter values based on defined conditions. You may want to filter observations greater than a certain threshold or only areas within a certain region. For example, you may want to select areas with a percentage of good health population over 50%:\n\nndf2 &lt;- census %&gt;% \n  filter( per_ghealth &lt; 0.5 )\n\nYou can use more than one variables to set conditions. Use “,” to add a condition.\n\n3.9.4 Joining Data Drames\nWhen working with spatial data, we often need to join data. To this end, you need a common unique id variable. Let’s say, we want to add a data frame containing census data on households for Liverpool, and join the new attributes to one of the existing data frames in the workspace. First we will read the data frame we want to join (i.e. census_data2.csv).\n\n# read data\ncensus2 &lt;- read.csv(\"data/census/census_data2.csv\")\n# visualise data structure\nstr(census2)\n\n'data.frame':   30 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ geo_code               : chr  \"E05000886\" \"E05000887\" \"E05000888\" \"E05000889\" ...\n $ households             : int  6359 6622 6622 7139 5391 5884 6576 6745 6317 6024 ...\n $ socialrented_households: int  827 1508 2818 1311 374 178 2859 1564 1023 1558 ...\n\n\nThe variable geo_code in this data frame corresponds to the code in the existing data frame and they are unique so they can be automatically matched by using the merge() function. The merge() function uses two arguments: x and y. The former refers to data frame 1 and the latter to data frame 2. Both of these two data frames must have a id variable containing the same information. Note they can have different names. Another key argument to include is all.x=TRUE which tells the function to keep all the records in x, but only those in y that match in case there are discrepancies in the id variable.\n\n# join data frames\njoin_dfs &lt;- merge( census, # df1\n                   census2, # df2\n                   by.x=\"code\", by.y=\"geo_code\", # common ids\n                   all.x = TRUE)\n# check data\nhead(join_dfs)\n\n       code                     ward pop16_74 higher_managerial   pop ghealth\n1 E05000886 Allerton and Hunts Cross    10930              1103 14853    7274\n2 E05000887                  Anfield    10712               312 14510    6124\n3 E05000888               Belle Vale    10987               432 15004    6129\n4 E05000889                  Central    19174              1346 20340   11925\n5 E05000890                Childwall    10410              1123 13908    7219\n6 E05000891                   Church    10569              1843 13974    7461\n  per_ghealth households socialrented_households\n1   0.4897327       6359                     827\n2   0.4220538       6622                    1508\n3   0.4084911       6622                    2818\n4   0.5862832       7139                    1311\n5   0.5190538       5391                     374\n6   0.5339201       5884                     178\n\n\n\n3.9.5 Saving Data\nIt may also be convenient to save your R projects. They contains all the objects that you have created in your workspace by using the save.image( ) function:\n\nsave.image(\"week1_envs453.RData\")\n\nThis creates a file labelled “week1_envs453.RData” in your working directory. You can load this at a later stage using the load( ) function.\n\nload(\"week1_envs453.RData\")\n\nAlternatively you can save / export your data into a csv file. The first argument in the function is the object name, and the second: the name of the csv we want to create.\n\nwrite.csv(join_dfs, \"join_censusdfs.csv\")",

    "section": "\n3.10 Using Spatial Data Frames",
    "text": "3.10 Using Spatial Data Frames\nA core area of the module is learning to work with spatial data in R. R has various purposedly designed packages for manipulation of spatial data and spatial analysis techniques. Various packages exist in CRAN, including sf (Pebesma 2018, 2022a), stars (Pebesma 2022b), terra, s2 (Dunnington, Pebesma, and Rubak 2023), lwgeom (Pebesma 2023), gstat (Pebesma 2004; Pebesma and Graeler 2022), spdep (Bivand 2022), spatialreg (Bivand and Piras 2022), spatstat (Baddeley, Rubak, and Turner 2015; Baddeley, Turner, and Rubak 2022), tmap (Tennekes 2018, 2022), mapview (Appelhans et al. 2022) and more. A key package is this ecosystem is sf (Pebesma and Bivand 2023). R package sf provides a table format for simple features, where feature geometries are stored in a list-column. It appeared in 2016 and was developed to move spatial data analysis in R closer to standards-based approaches seen in the industry and open source projects, to build upon more modern versions of open source geospatial software stack and allow for integration of R spatial software with the tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019), particularly ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr. Hence, this book relies heavely on sf for the manipulation and analysis of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow (2024) provide a helpful overview and evolution of R spatial package ecosystem.\n\n\nTo read our spatial data, we use the st_read function.

Normally you use plot to get a quick inspection of the data and tmap and ggplot to get publication quality data visualisations. First plot is used to map the spatial distribution of non-British-born population in Liverpool. First we only map the geometries on the right.\nUsing plot\nWe can use the base plot function to display the boundaries of OAs in Liverpool.\n\n# mapping geometry\nplot(st_geometry(oa_shp))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo visualise a column in the spatial data frame, we can run:\n\n# map attributes, adding intervals\nplot(oa_shp[\"Ethnic\"], # variable to visualise\n     key.pos = 4, \n     axes = TRUE, \n     key.width = lcm(1.3), \n     key.length = 1.,\n     breaks = \"jenks\", # algorithm to categorise the data\n     lwd = 0.1, \n     border = 'grey') # boundary colour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\nWhat is the key pattern emerging from this map?\n\n\n\nLet us now explore ggplot or tmap.\nUsing ggplot\nWe can visualise spatial data frames using ggplot fairly easily. ggplot is a generic sets of functions which was not specifically designed for spatial mapping, but it is fairly flexible that allows producing great spatial data visualisations.\nFollowing the grammar of ggplot, we plot spatial data drawing layers. ggplot has a basic structure of three components:\n\nThe data i.e. ggplot( data = *data frame*).\nGeometries i.e. geom_xxx( ).\nAesthetic mapping i.e. aes(x=*variable*, y=*variable*)\n\n\nWe can put these three components together using +. This is similar to the ways we apply the pipe operator in for tidyverse. The latter component of aesthetic mapping can be added in both the ggplot and geom_xxx functions.\nTo map our data, we can then run:\n\nggplot(data = oa_shp, aes( fill = Ethnic) ) + # add data frame and variable to map\n  geom_sf(colour = \"gray60\",  # colour line\n          size = 0.1) # line size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the colour palette by using a different colour palette. We can use the viridis package. The power of viridis is that it uses color scales that visually pleasing, colorblind friendly, print well in gray scale, and can be used for both categorical and continuous data. For categorical data you can also use ColourBrewer.\nSo let us (1) change the colour pallete to viridis, (2) remove the colour of the boundaries, and (3) replace the theme with the theme we will be using for the book. Let’s read the theme first and then implement these changes.\nThe ggplot themes for the book are in a file called data-visualisation_theme.R in the style folder. We read this file by running:\n\nsource(\"./style/data-visualisation_theme.R\")\n\nLoading required package: sysfonts\n\n\nLoading required package: showtextdb\n\n\nWe can now implement our changes:\n\nggplot(data = oa_shp, aes( fill = Ethnic) ) + # add data frame and variable to map\n  geom_sf(colour = \"transparent\") + # colour line\n  scale_fill_viridis( option = \"viridis\" ) + # add viridis colour scheme\n  theme_map_tufte()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo master ggplot, see Wickham (2009).\nUsing tmap\nSimilar to ggplot2, tmap is based on the idea of a ‘grammar of graphics’ which involves a separation between the input data and aesthetics (i.e. the way data are visualised). Each data set can be mapped in various different ways, including location as defined by its geometry, colour and other features. The basic building block is tm_shape() (which defines input data), followed by one or more layer elements such as tm_fill() and tm_dots().\n\n# ensure geometry is valid\noa_shp = sf::st_make_valid(oa_shp)\n\n# map\nlegend_title = expression(\"% ethnic pop.\")\nmap_oa = tm_shape(oa_shp) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Ethnic\", title = legend_title, palette = magma(256), style = \"cont\") + # add fill\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .01)  + # add borders\n  tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\") , size = 4) + # add compass\n  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0,1,2), text.size = 0.5, position =  c(\"center\", \"bottom\")) # add scale bar\nmap_oa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the operation +, as for ggplot is used to add new layers. You can set style themes by tm_style. To visualise the existing styles use tmap_style_catalogue(). An advantage of tmap is that you can easily create an interactive map by running tmap_mode.\n\ntmap_mode(\"view\")\n\ntmap mode set to interactive viewing\n\nmap_oa\n\nCompass not supported in view mode.\n\n\nWarning: In view mode, scale bar breaks are ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\nTry mapping other variables in the spatial data frame. Where do population aged 60 and over concentrate?\n\n\n\n\n3.10.3 Comparing geographies\nIf you recall, one of the key issues of working with spatial data is the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP) - see (spatial_data?). To get a sense of the effects of MAUP, we analyse differences in the spatial patterns of the ethnic population in Liverpool between Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) and OAs. So we map these geographies together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe first line of the chunk code include tmap_mode(\"plot\") which tells R that we want a static map. tmap_mode works like a switch to interactive and non-interactive mapping.\n\n\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\ntmap mode set to plotting\n\n# read data at the msoa level\nmsoa_shp &lt;- st_read(\"data/census/Liverpool_MSOA.shp\")\n\nReading layer `Liverpool_MSOA' from data source \n  `/Users/franciscorowe/Dropbox/Francisco/uol/teaching/envs453/202324/san/data/census/Liverpool_MSOA.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 61 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 333086.1 ymin: 381426.3 xmax: 345636 ymax: 397980.1\nProjected CRS: Transverse_Mercator\n\n# ensure geometry is valid\nmsoa_shp = sf::st_make_valid(msoa_shp)\n\n# create a map\nmap_msoa = tm_shape(msoa_shp) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Ethnic\", title = legend_title, palette = magma(256), style = \"cont\") + \n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .01)  + \n  tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\") , size = 4) + \n  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0,1,2), text.size = 0.5, position =  c(\"center\", \"bottom\")) \n\n# arrange maps \ntmap_arrange(map_msoa, map_oa) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\nWhat differences do you see between OAs and MSOAs?\nCan you identify areas of spatial clustering?

To get a sense of what they look like first, let us plot both. We can get a quick look at the non-spatial distribution of house values with the following commands:\n\n# Create the histogram\nqplot( data = db, x = price)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis basically shows there is a lot of values concentrated around the lower end of the distribution but a few very large ones. A usual transformation to shrink these differences is to take logarithms. The original table already contains an additional column with the logarithm of each price (log_price).\n\n# Create the histogram\nqplot( data = db, x = log_price )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo obtain the spatial distribution of these houses, we need to focus on the geometry column. The easiest, quickest (and also “dirtiest”) way to get a sense of what the data look like over space is using plot:\n\nplot(st_geometry(db))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow this has the classic problem of cluttering: some portions of the map have so many points that we can’t tell what the distribution is like. To get around this issue, there are two solutions: binning and smoothing.",

    "text": "4.4 KDE\nKernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a technique that creates a continuous representation of the distribution of a given variable, such as house prices. Although theoretically it can be applied to any dimension, usually, KDE is applied to either one or two dimensions.\n\n4.4.1 One-dimensional KDE\nKDE over a single dimension is essentially a contiguous version of a histogram. We can see that by overlaying a KDE on top of the histogram of logs that we have created before:\n\n# Create the base\nbase &lt;- ggplot(db, aes(x=log_price))\n# Histogram\nhist &lt;- base + \n  geom_histogram(bins=50, aes(y=..density..))\n# Overlay density plot\nkde &lt;- hist + \n  geom_density(fill=\"#FF6666\", alpha=0.5, colour=\"#FF6666\") +\n  theme_plot_tufte()\nkde\n\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..density..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(density)` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key idea is that we are smoothing out the discrete binning that the histogram involves. Note how the histogram is exactly the same as above shape-wise, but it has been rescalend on the Y axis to reflect probabilities rather than counts.\n\n4.4.2 Two-dimensional (spatial) KDE\nGeography, at the end of the day, is usually represented as a two-dimensional space where we locate objects using a system of dual coordinates, X and Y (or latitude and longitude). Thanks to that, we can use the same technique as above to obtain a smooth representation of the distribution of a two-dimensional variable. The crucial difference is that, instead of obtaining a curve as the output, we will create a surface, where intensity will be represented with a color gradient, rather than with the second dimension, as it is the case in the figure above.\nTo create a spatial KDE in R, we can use general tooling for non-spatial points, such as the stat_density2d_filled method:\n\n# Create the KDE surface\nkde &lt;- ggplot(data = db) +\n  stat_density2d_filled(alpha = 1,\n    data = as.data.frame(st_coordinates(db)), \n    aes(x = X, y = Y),\n    n = 100\n  ) +\n  # Tweak the color gradient\n  scale_color_viridis_c() +\n  # White theme\n  theme_plot_tufte() \nkde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach generates a surface that represents the density of dots, that is an estimation of the probability of finding a house transaction at a given coordinate. However, without any further information, they are hard to interpret and link with previous knowledge of the area. To bring such context to the figure, we can plot an underlying basemap, using a cloud provider such as Google Maps or, as in this case, OpenStreetMap. To do it, we will leverage the library basemapR, which is designed to play nicely with the ggplot2 family (hence the seemingly counterintuitive example above). Before we can plot them with the online map, we need to reproject them though.\n\nbbox_db &lt;- st_bbox(db)\nggplot() +\n  base_map(bbox_db, increase_zoom = 2, basemap = \"positron\") +\n  #geom_sf(data = db, fill = NA) +\n  stat_density2d_filled(alpha = 0.7,\n    data = as.data.frame(st_coordinates(db)), \n    aes(x = X, y = Y),\n    n = 100\n  )",

    "section": "\n4.5 Spatial Interpolation",
    "text": "4.5 Spatial Interpolation\nThe previous section demonstrates how to visualize the distribution of a set of spatial objects represented as points. In particular, given a bunch of house locations, it shows how one can effectively visualize their distribution over space and get a sense of the density of occurrences. Such visualization, because it is based on KDE, is based on a smooth continuum, rather than on a discrete approach (as a choropleth would do, for example).\nMany times however, we are not particularly interested in learning about the density of occurrences, but about the distribution of a given value attached to each location. Think for example of weather stations and temperature: the location of the stations is no secret and rarely changes, so it is not of particular interest to visualize the density of stations; what we are usually interested instead is to know how temperature is distributed over space, given we only measure it in a few places. One could argue the example we have been working with so far, house prices in AirBnb, fits into this category as well: although where a house is advertised may be of relevance, more often we are interested in finding out what the “surface of price” looks like. Rather than where are most houses being advertised? we usually want to know where the most expensive or most affordable houses are located.\nIn cases where we are interested in creating a surface of a given value, rather than a simple density surface of occurrences, KDE cannot help us. In these cases, what we are interested in is spatial interpolation, a family of techniques that aim at exactly that: creating continuous surfaces for a particular phenomenon (e.g. temperature, house prices) given only a finite sample of observations. Spatial interpolation is a large field of research that is still being actively developed and that can involve a substantial amount of mathematical complexity in order to obtain the most accurate estimates possible1. In this chapter, we will introduce the simplest possible way of interpolating values, hoping this will give you a general understanding of the methodology and, if you are interested, you can check out further literature. For example, Banerjee, Carlin, and Gelfand (2014) or Cressie (2015) are hard but good overviews.\n1 There is also an important economic incentive to do this: some of the most popular applications are in the oil and gas or mining industries. In fact, the very creator of this technique, Danie G. Krige, was a mining engineer. His name is usually used to nickname spatial interpolation as kriging.\n4.5.1 Inverse Distance Weight (IDW) interpolation\nThe technique we will cover here is called Inverse Distance Weighting, or IDW for convenience. Brunsdon and Comber (2015) offer a good description:\n\nIn the inverse distance weighting (IDW) approach to interpolation, to estimate the value of \\(z\\) at location \\(x\\) a weighted mean of nearby observations is taken […]. To accommodate the idea that observations of \\(z\\) at points closer to \\(x\\) should be given more importance in the interpolation, greater weight is given to these points […]\n— Page 204\n\nThe math2 is not particularly complicated and may be found in detail elsewhere (the reference above is a good starting point), so we will not spend too much time on it. More relevant in this context is the intuition behind. The idea is that we will create a surface of house price by smoothing many values arranged along a regular grid and obtained by interpolating from the known locations to the regular grid locations. This will give us full and equal coverage to soundly perform the smoothing.\n2 Essentially, for any point \\(x\\) in space, the IDW estimate for value \\(z\\) is equivalent to \\(\\hat{z} (x) = \\dfrac{\\sum_i w_i z_i}{\\sum_i w_i}\\) where \\(i\\) are the observations for which we do have a value, and \\(w_i\\) is a weight given to location \\(i\\) based on its distance to \\(x\\).3 If you want a complementary view of point interpolation in R, you can read more on this fantastic blog postEnough chat, let’s code3.\nFrom what we have just mentioned, there are a few steps to perform an IDW spatial interpolation:\n\nCreate a regular grid over the area where we have house transactions.\nObtain IDW estimates for each point in the grid, based on the values of \\(k\\) nearest neighbors.\nPlot a smoothed version of the grid, effectively representing the surface of house prices.\n\nLet us go in detail into each of them4. First, let us set up a grid for the extent of the bounding box of our data (not the use of pipe, %&gt;%, operator to chain functions):\n4 For the relevant calculations, we will be using the gstat library.\nsd.grid &lt;- db %&gt;%\n  st_bbox() %&gt;%\n  st_as_sfc() %&gt;%\n  st_make_grid(\n    n = 100,\n    what = \"centers\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  cbind(., st_coordinates(.))\n\nThe object sd.grid is a regular grid with 10,000 (\\(100 \\times 100\\)) equally spaced cells:\n\nsd.grid\n\nSimple feature collection with 10000 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -117.2795 ymin: 32.57604 xmax: -116.9569 ymax: 33.08056\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\nFirst 10 features:\n           X        Y                          x\n1  -117.2795 32.57604 POINT (-117.2795 32.57604)\n2  -117.2763 32.57604 POINT (-117.2763 32.57604)\n3  -117.2730 32.57604  POINT (-117.273 32.57604)\n4  -117.2698 32.57604 POINT (-117.2698 32.57604)\n5  -117.2665 32.57604 POINT (-117.2665 32.57604)\n6  -117.2632 32.57604 POINT (-117.2632 32.57604)\n7  -117.2600 32.57604   POINT (-117.26 32.57604)\n8  -117.2567 32.57604 POINT (-117.2567 32.57604)\n9  -117.2535 32.57604 POINT (-117.2535 32.57604)\n10 -117.2502 32.57604 POINT (-117.2502 32.57604)\n\n\nNow, sd.grid only contain the location of points to which we wish to interpolate. That is, we now have our “target” geography for which we’d like to have AirBnb prices, but we don’t have price estimates. For that, on to the IDW, which will generate estimates for locations in sd.grid based on the observed prices in db. Again, this is hugely simplified by gstat:\n\nidw.hp &lt;- idw(\n  price ~ 1,         # Formula for IDW\n  locations = db,    # Initial locations with values\n  newdata=sd.grid,   # Locations we want predictions for\n  nmax = 150         # Limit the number of neighbours for IDW\n)\n\n[inverse distance weighted interpolation]\n\n\nBoom! We’ve got it. Let us pause for a second to see how we just did it. First, we pass price ~ 1. This specifies the formula we are using to model house prices. The name on the left of ~ represents the variable we want to explain, while everything to its right captures the explanatory variables. Since we are considering the simplest possible case, we do not have further variables to add, so we simply write 1. Then we specify the original locations for which we do have house prices (our original db object), and the points where we want to interpolate the house prices (the sd.grid object we just created above). One more note: by default, idw uses all the available observations, weighted by distance, to provide an estimate for a given point. If you want to modify that and restrict the maximum number of neighbors to consider, you need to tweak the argument nmax, as we do above by using the 150 nearest observations to each point5.\n5 Have a play with this because the results do change significantly. Can you reason why?The object we get from idw is another spatial table, just as db, containing the interpolated values. As such, we can inspect it just as with any other of its kind. For example, to check out the top of the estimated table:\n\nhead(idw.hp)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -117.2795 ymin: 32.57604 xmax: -117.2632 ymax: 32.57604\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n  var1.pred var1.var                   geometry\n1  295.6100       NA POINT (-117.2795 32.57604)\n2  295.1651       NA POINT (-117.2763 32.57604)\n3  296.5927       NA  POINT (-117.273 32.57604)\n4  288.2252       NA POINT (-117.2698 32.57604)\n5  281.5522       NA POINT (-117.2665 32.57604)\n6  268.3567       NA POINT (-117.2632 32.57604)\n\n\nThe column we will pay attention to is var1.pred. For a hypothetical house advertised at the location in the first row of point in sd.grid, the price IDW would guess it would cost, based on prices nearby, is the first element of column var1.pred in idw.hp.\n\n4.5.2 A surface of housing prices\nOnce we have the IDW object computed, we can plot it to explore the distribution, not of AirBnb locations in this case, but of house prices over the geography of San Diego. To do this using ggplot2, we first append the coordinates of each grid cell as columns of the table:\n\nidw.hp = idw.hp %&gt;%\n  cbind(st_coordinates(.))\n\nNow, we can visualise the surface using standard ggplot2 tools:\n\nggplot(idw.hp, aes(x = X, y = Y, fill = var1.pred)) +\n  geom_raster()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we can “dress it up” a bit further:\n\nggplot(idw.hp, aes(x = X, y = Y, fill = var1.pred)) +\n  geom_raster() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_b() +\n  theme_void() +\n  geom_sf(alpha=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this, we can start to tell some patterns. To bring in context, it would be great to be able to add a basemap layer, as we did for the KDE. This is conceptually very similar to what we did above, starting by reprojecting the points and continuing by overlaying them on top of the basemap. However, technically speaking it is not possible because ggmap –the library we have been using to display tiles from cloud providers– does not play well with our own rasters (i.e. the price surface). At the moment, it is surprisingly tricky to get this to work, so we will park it for now6.\n6 BONUS if you can figure out a way to do it yourself!\n4.5.3 “What should the next house’s price be?”\n\nThe last bit we will explore in this session relates to prediction for new values. Imagine you are a real state data scientist working for Airbnb and your boss asks you to give an estimate of how much a new house going into the market should cost. The only information you have to make such a guess is the location of the house. In this case, the IDW model we have just fitted can help you. The trick is realizing that, instead of creating an entire grid, all we need is to obtain an estimate of a single location.\nLet us say, a new house is going to be advertised on the coordinates X = -117.02259063720702, Y = 32.76511965117273 as expressed in longitude and latitude. In that case, we can do as follows:\n\npt &lt;- c(X = -117.02259063720702, Y = 32.76511965117273) %&gt;%\n  st_point() %&gt;%\n  st_sfc() %&gt;%\n  st_sf(crs = \"EPSG:4326\") %&gt;%\n  st_transform(st_crs(db))\nidw.one &lt;- idw(price ~ 1, locations=db, newdata=pt)\n\n[inverse distance weighted interpolation]\n\nidw.one\n\nSimple feature collection with 1 feature and 2 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -117.0226 ymin: 32.76512 xmax: -117.0226 ymax: 32.76512\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n  var1.pred var1.var                   geometry\n1  171.4141       NA POINT (-117.0226 32.76512)\n\n\nAnd, as show above, the estimated value is $171.41413347.\n7 PRO QUESTION Is that house expensive or cheap, as compared to the other houses sold in this dataset? Can you figure out where the house is in the distribution?",

For example, to get the shape of the trip from station 39 to station 48, we can:\n\ndb %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(orig == 39 & dest == 48) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(data = .) + \n  geom_sf(color = \"black\", \n          size = 0.1) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor, for the most popular route, we can:\n\nmost_pop &lt;- db %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(trips15 == max(trips15))\n\nThese however do not reveal a lot: there is no geographical context (why are there so many routes along the NE?) and no sense of how volumes of bikers are allocated along different routes. Let us fix those two.\nThe easiest way to bring in geographical context is by overlaying the routes on top of a background map of tiles downloaded from the internet. Let us download this using basemapR:\n\n# create a bounding box\nbbox_db &lt;- st_bbox(db)\n# download a basemap using ggplot and basemapR\nggplot() +\n  base_map(bbox_db, increase_zoom = 2, basemap = \"positron\") +\n  geom_sf(data = db, fill = NA, colour = \"transparent\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow to combine tiles and routes, we need to pull out the coordinates that make up each line. For the route example above, this would be:\n\nxys1 &lt;- as.data.frame(st_coordinates(most_pop))\n\nNow we can plot the route (note we also dim down the background to focus the attention on flows):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\nCan you plot the route for the largest climb?\n\n\n\n\nggplot() +\n  base_map(bbox_db, increase_zoom = 2, basemap = \"dark\") +\n    geom_sf( data = db, fill = NA, colour = \"transparent\") +\n  geom_path( data = xys1, \n             aes( x = X, y = Y ), \n             #size = 1,\n             color = \"green\",\n             lineend ='round'\n             )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can plot all of the lines by using a short for loop to build up the table:\n\n# Set up shell data.frame\nlines &lt;- data.frame(\n  lat = numeric(0), \n  lon = numeric(0), \n  trips = numeric(0),\n  id = numeric(0)\n)\n# Run loop\nfor(x in 1:nrow(db)){\n  # Pull out row\n  r &lt;- db[x, ]\n  # Extract lon/lat coords\n  xys &lt;- as.data.frame(st_coordinates(r))\n  names(xys) &lt;- c('lon', 'lat')\n  # Insert trips and id\n  xys['trips'] &lt;- r$trips15\n  xys['id'] &lt;- x\n  # Append them to `lines`\n  lines &lt;- rbind(lines, xys)\n}\n\nNow we can go on and plot all of them:\n\nggplot() +\n  # call basemap\n  base_map(bbox_db, increase_zoom = 2, basemap = \"dark\") +\n  geom_sf(data = db, fill = NA, colour = \"transparent\") +\n  # add data\n  geom_path( data = lines, \n             aes(x=lon, y=lat, \n                 group=id\n                 ), \n             size = 1,\n             color = \"green\",\n             lineend = 'round')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can get a sense of the distribution of the flows by associating a color gradient to each flow based on its number of trips:\n\nggplot() +\n  # call basemap\n  base_map(bbox_db, increase_zoom = 2, basemap = \"dark\") +\n  geom_sf(data = db, fill = NA, colour = \"transparent\") +\n  # add flow data\n  geom_path( data = lines, \n             aes(x = lon, y = lat, group = id, colour = trips ), \n             size=log1p(lines$trips / max(lines$trips)),\n             lineend = 'round'\n    ) +\n  # create a colour palette\n  scale_colour_gradient(\n    low='#440154FF', high='#FDE725FF'\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote how we transform the size so it’s a proportion of the largest trip and then it is compressed with a logarithm.",

    "text": "5.4 Modelling flows\nNow we have an idea of the spatial distribution of flows, we can begin to think about modeling them. The core idea in this section is to fit a model that can capture the particular characteristics of our variable of interest (the volume of trips) using a set of predictors that describe the nature of a given flow. We will start from the simplest model and then progressively build complexity until we get to a satisfying point. Along the way, we will be exploring each model using concepts from Gelman and Hill (2006) such as predictive performance checks1 (PPC)\n1 For a more elaborate introduction to PPC, have a look at Chapters 7 and 8.Before we start running regressions, let us first standardize the predictors so we can interpret the intercept as the average flow when all the predictors take the average value, and so we can interpret the model coefficients as changes in standard deviation units:\n\n# Scale all the table\ndb_std &lt;- db %&gt;% mutate(across(where(is.numeric), scale))\n\n# Reset trips as we want the original version\ndb_std$trips15 &lt;- db$trips15\ndb_std$trips16 &lt;- db$trips16\n\n# Reset origin and destination station and express them as factors\ndb_std$orig &lt;- as.factor(db$orig)\ndb_std$dest &lt;- as.factor(db$dest)\n\nBaseline model\nOne of the simplest possible models we can fit in this context is a linear model that explains the number of trips as a function of the straight distance between the two stations and total amount of climb and downhill. We will take this as the baseline on which we can further build later:\n\nm1 &lt;- lm('trips15 ~ straight_dist + total_up + total_down', data=db_std)\nsummary(m1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = \"trips15 ~ straight_dist + total_up + total_down\", \n    data = db_std)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-261.9 -168.3 -102.4   30.8 3527.4 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

A first approach is to simply plot the distribution of both variables:\n\nplot(\n  density( m1$fitted.values ), \n  xlim = c(-100, max( db_std$trips15 )),\n  main=''\n)\nlines(\n  density( db_std$trips15 ), \n  col='red',\n  main=''\n)\nlegend(\n  'topright', \n  c('Predicted', 'Actual'),\n  col=c('black', 'red'),\n  lwd=1\n)\ntitle(main=\"Predictive check, point estimates - Baseline model\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot makes pretty obvious that our initial model captures very few aspects of the distribution we want to explain. However, we should not get too attached to this plot just yet. What it is showing is the distribution of predicted point estimates from our model. Since our model is not deterministic but inferential, there is a certain degree of uncertainty attached to its predictions, and that is completely absent from this plot.\nGenerally speaking, a given model has two sources of uncertainty: predictive, and inferential. The former relates to the fact that the equation we fit does not capture all the elements or in the exact form they enter the true data generating process; the latter has to do with the fact that we never get to know the true value of the model parameters only guesses (estimates) subject to error and uncertainty. If you think of our linear model above as\n\\[\nT_{ij} = X_{ij}\\beta + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\] where \\(T_{ij}\\) represents the number of trips undertaken between station \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), \\(X_{ij}\\) is the set of explanatory variables (length, climb, descent, etc.), and \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is an error term assumed to be distributed as a normal distribution \\(N(0, \\sigma)\\); then predictive uncertainty comes from the fact that there are elements to some extent relevant for \\(y\\) that are not accounted for and thus subsummed into \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\). Inferential uncertainty comes from the fact that we never get to know \\(\\beta\\) but only an estimate of it which is also subject to uncertainty itself.\nTaking these two sources into consideration means that the black line in the plot above represents only the behaviour of our model we expect if the error term is absent (no predictive uncertainty) and the coefficients are the true estimates (no inferential uncertainty). However, this is not necessarily the case as our estimate for the uncertainty of the error term is certainly not zero, and our estimates for each parameter are also subject to a great deal of inferential variability. We do not know to what extent other outcomes would be just as likely. Predictive checking relates to simulating several feasible scenarios under our model and use those to assess uncertainty and to get a better grasp of the quality of our predictions.\nTechnically speaking, to do this, we need to build a mechanism to obtain a possible draw from our model and then repeat it several times. The first part of those two steps can be elegantly dealt with by writing a short function that takes a given model and a set of predictors, and produces a possible random draw from such model:\n\ngenerate_draw &lt;- function(m){\n  # Set up predictors matrix\n  x &lt;- model.matrix( m )\n  # Obtain draws of parameters (inferential uncertainty)\n  sim_bs &lt;- sim( m, 1)\n  # Predicted value\n  mu &lt;- x %*% sim_bs@coef[1, ]\n  # Draw\n  n &lt;- length( mu )\n  y_hat &lt;- rnorm( n, mu, sim_bs@sigma[1])\n  return(y_hat)\n}\n\nThis function takes a model m and the set of covariates x used and returns a random realisation of predictions from the model. To get a sense of how this works, we can get and plot a realisation of the model, compared to the expected one and the actual values:\n\nnew_y &lt;- generate_draw(m1)\n\nplot(\n  density( m1$fitted.values ), \n  xlim = c(-100, max( db_std$trips15 )),\n  ylim = c(0, max(c(\n                   max( density( m1$fitted.values)$y ), \n                   max( density( db_std$trips15)$y )\n                   )\n                )\n         ),\n  col = 'black',\n  main = ''\n)\nlines(\n  density( db_std$trips15 ), \n  col = 'red',\n  main = ''\n)\nlines(\n  density( new_y ), \n  col = 'green',\n  main = ''\n)\nlegend(\n  'topright', \n  c('Predicted', 'Actual', 'Simulated'),\n  col = c( 'black', 'red', 'green' ),\n  lwd = 1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have this “draw engine”, we can set it to work as many times as we want using a simple for loop. In fact, we can directly plot these lines as compared to the expected one and the trip count:\n\nplot(\n  density( m1$fitted.values ), \n  xlim = c(-100, max( db_std$trips15 )),\n  ylim = c(0, max(c(\n               max( density( m1$fitted.values)$y ), \n               max( density( db_std$trips15)$y )\n               )\n            )\n     ),\n  col='white',\n  main=''\n)\n# Loop for realizations\nfor(i in 1:250){\n  tmp_y &lt;- generate_draw( m1 )\n  lines( density( tmp_y ),\n        col = 'grey',\n        lwd = 0.1\n        )\n}\n#\nlines(\n  density( m1$fitted.values ), \n  col = 'black',\n  main = ''\n)\nlines(\n  density( db_std$trips15 ), \n  col = 'red',\n  main = ''\n)\nlegend(\n  'topright', \n  c('Actual', 'Predicted', 'Simulated (n=250)'),\n  col = c('red', 'black', 'grey'),\n  lwd = 1\n)\ntitle(main=\"Predictive check - Baseline model\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows there is a significant mismatch between the fitted values, which are much more concentrated around small positive values, and the realisations of our “inferential engine”, which depict a much less concentrated distribution of values. This is likely due to the combination of two different reasons: on the one hand, the accuracy of our estimates may be poor, causing them to jump around a wide range of potential values and hence resulting in very diverse predictions (inferential uncertainty); on the other hand, it may be that the amount of variation we are not able to account for in the model2 is so large that the degree of uncertainty contained in the error term of the model is very large, hence resulting in such a flat predictive distribution.\n2 The \\(R^2\\) of our model is around 2%3 which they are not really, in light of the comparison between the black and red lines.Keep in mind that the issues discussed in the paragraph above relate to the uncertainty behind our model. This is not to the point predictions derived from them, which are a mechanistic result of the minimisation of the squared residuals and hence are not subject to probability or inference. That allows the model in this case to provide a fitted distribution much more accurate apparently (black line above). However, the lesson to take from the model is that, even if the point predictions (fitted values) are artificially accurate3, our capabilities to infer about the more general underlying process are fairly limited.\nImproving the model\nThe bad news from the previous section is that our initial model is not great at explaining bike trips. The good news is there are several ways in which we can improve this. In this section we will cover three main extensions that exemplify three different routes you can take when enriching and augmenting models in general, and spatial interaction ones in particular4. These three routes are aligned around the following principles:\n4 These principles are general and can be applied to pretty much any modeling exercise you run into. The specific approaches we take in this note relate to spatial interaction models\nUse better approximations to model your dependent variable.\nRecognize the structure of your data.\nGet better predictors.\n\n\nUse better approximations to model your dependent variable\n\nStandard OLS regression assumes that the error term and, since the predictors are deterministic, the dependent variable are distributed following a normal (gaussian) distribution. This is usually a good approximation for several phenomena of interest, but maybe not the best one for trips along routes: for one, we know trips cannot be negative, which the normal distribution does not account for5; more subtly, their distribution is not really symmetric but skewed with a very long tail on the right. This is common in variables that represent counts and that is why usually it is more appropriate to fit a model that relies on a distribution different from the normal.\n5 For an illustration of this, consider the amount of probability mass to the left of zero in the predictive checks above.One of the most common distributions for this cases is the Poisson, which can be incorporated through a general linear model (or GLM). The underlying assumption here is that instead of \\(T_{ij} \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\sigma)\\), our model now follows:\n\\[\nT_{ij} \\sim Poisson (\\exp^{X_{ij}\\beta})\n\\]\nAs usual, such a model is easy to run in R:\n\nm2 &lt;- glm(\n  'trips15 ~ straight_dist + total_up + total_down', \n  data=db_std,\n  family=poisson,\n)\n\nNow let’s see how much better, if any, this approach is. To get a quick overview, we can simply plot the point predictions:\n\nplot(\n  density( m2$fitted.values ), \n  xlim = c( -100, max( db_std$trips15 )),\n  ylim = c( 0, max(c(\n               max( density( m2$fitted.values)$y ), \n               max( density(db_std$trips15)$y )\n               )\n            )\n   ),\n  col = 'black',\n  main = ''\n)\nlines(\n  density( db_std$trips15 ), \n  col = 'red',\n  main = ''\n)\nlegend(\n  'topright', \n  c('Predicted', 'Actual'),\n  col = c('black', 'red'),\n  lwd = 1\n)\ntitle(main = \"Predictive check, point estimates - Poisson model\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo incorporate uncertainty to these predictions, we need to tweak our generate_draw function so it accommodates the fact that our model is not linear anymore.\n\ngenerate_draw_poi &lt;- function(m){\n  # Set up predictors matrix\n  x &lt;- model.matrix( m )\n  # Obtain draws of parameters (inferential uncertainty)\n  sim_bs &lt;- sim( m, 1 )\n  # Predicted value\n  xb &lt;- x %*% sim_bs@coef[1, ]\n  #xb &lt;- x %*% m$coefficients\n  # Transform using the link function\n  mu &lt;- exp( xb )\n  # Obtain a random realization\n  y_hat &lt;- rpois( n = length( mu ), lambda = mu)\n  return(y_hat)\n}\n\nAnd then we can examine both point predictions an uncertainty around them:\n\nplot(\n  density( m2$fitted.values ), \n  xlim = c(-100, max( db_std$trips15 )),\n  ylim = c(0, max(c(\n               max( density( m2$fitted.values)$y ), \n               max( density( db_std$trips15)$y )\n               )\n            )\n   ),\n  col = 'white',\n  main = ''\n)\n# Loop for realizations\nfor(i in 1:250){\n  tmp_y &lt;- generate_draw_poi( m2 )\n  lines(\n    density( tmp_y ),\n    col = 'grey',\n    lwd = 0.1\n  )\n}\n#\nlines(\n  density( m2$fitted.values ), \n  col = 'black',\n  main = ''\n)\nlines(\n  density( db_std$trips15 ), \n  col = 'red',\n  main = ''\n)\nlegend(\n  'topright', \n  c('Predicted', 'Actual', 'Simulated (n=250)'),\n  col = c('black', 'red', 'grey'),\n  lwd = 1\n)\ntitle( main = \"Predictive check - Poisson model\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoila! Although the curve is still a bit off, centered too much to the right of the actual data, our predictive simulation leaves the fitted values right in the middle. This speaks to a better fit of the model to the actual distribution othe original data follow.\n\nRecognize the structure of your data\n\nSo far, we’ve treated our dataset as if it was flat (i.e. comprise of fully independent realizations) when in fact it is not. Most crucially, our baseline model does not account for the fact that every observation in the dataset pertains to a trip between two stations. This means that all the trips from or to the same station probably share elements which likely help explain how many trips are undertaken between stations. For example, think of trips to and from a station located in the famous Embarcadero, a popular tourist spot. Every route to and from there probably has more trips due to the popularity of the area and we are currently not acknowledging it in the model.\nA simple way to incorporate these effects into the model is through origin and destination fixed effects. This approach shares elements with both spatial fixed effects and multilevel modeling and essentially consists of including a binary variable for every origin and destination station. In mathematical notation, this equates to:\n\\[\nT_{ij} = X_{ij}\\beta + \\delta_i + \\delta_j + \\epsilon_{ij}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\delta_i\\) and \\(\\delta_j\\) are origin and destination station fixed effects6, and the rest is as above. This strategy accounts for all the unobserved heterogeneity associated with the location of the station. Technically speaking, we simply need to introduce orig and dest in the the model:\n6 In this session, \\(\\delta_i\\) and \\(\\delta_j\\) are estimated as independent variables so their estimates are similar to interpret to those in \\(\\beta\\). An alternative approach could be to model them as random effects in a multilevel framework.\nm3 &lt;- glm(\n  'trips15 ~ straight_dist + total_up + total_down + orig + dest', \n  data = db_std,\n  family = poisson\n)\n\nAnd with our new model, we can have a look at how well it does at predicting the overall number of trips7:\n7 Although, theoretically, we could also include simulations of the model in the plot to get a better sense of the uncertainty behind our model, in practice this seems troublesome. The problems most likely arise from the fact that many of the origin and destination binary variable coefficients are estimated with a great deal of uncertainty. This causes some of the simulation to generate extreme values that, when passed through the exponential term of the Poisson link function, cause problems. If anything, this is testimony of how a simple fixed effect model can sometimes lack accuracy and generate very uncertain estimates. A potential extension to work around these problems could be to fit a multilevel model with two specific levels beyond the trip-level: one for origin and another one for destination stations.\nplot(\n  density( m3$fitted.values ), \n  xlim = c(-100, max( db_std$trips15 )),\n  ylim = c(0, max(c(\n               max( density(m3$fitted.values)$y ), \n               max( density(db_std$trips15)$y )\n               )\n            )\n   ),\n  col = 'black',\n  main = ''\n)\nlines(\n  density( db_std$trips15 ), \n  col = 'red',\n  main = ''\n)\nlegend(\n  'topright', \n  c('Predicted', 'Actual'),\n  col = c('black', 'red'),\n  lwd = 1\n)\ntitle( main = \"Predictive check - Orig/dest FE Poisson model\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat looks significantly better, doesn’t it? In fact, our model now better accounts for the long tail where a few routes take a lot of trips. This is likely because the distribution of trips is far from random across stations and our origin and destination fixed effects do a decent job at accounting for that structure. However our model is still notably underpredicting less popular routes and overpredicting routes with above average number of trips. Maybe we should think about moving beyond a simple linear model.\n\nGet better predictors\n\nThe final extension is, in principle, always available but, in practice, it can be tricky to implement. The core idea is that your baseline model might not have the best measurement of the phenomena you want to account for. In our example, we can think of the distance between stations. So far, we have been including the distance measured “as the crow flies” between stations. Although in some cases this is a good approximation (particularly when distances are long and likely route taken is as close to straight as possible), in some cases like ours, where the street layout and the presence of elevation probably matter more than the actual final distance pedalled, this is not necessarily a safe assumption.\nAs an exampe of this approach, we can replace the straight distance measurements for more refined ones based on the Google Maps API routes. This is very easy as all we need to do (once the distances have been calculated!) is to swap straight_dist for street_dist:\n\nm4 &lt;- glm(\n  'trips15 ~ street_dist + total_up + total_down + orig + dest', \n  data = db_std,\n  family = poisson\n)\n\nAnd we can similarly get a sense of our predictive fitting with:\n\nplot(\n  density( m4$fitted.values ), \n  xlim = c(-100, max( db_std$trips15)),\n  ylim = c(0, max(c(\n               max( density(m4$fitted.values)$y ), \n               max( density(db_std$trips15)$y )\n               )\n            )\n   ),\n  col = 'black',\n  main = ''\n)\nlines(\n  density( db_std$trips15 ), \n  col = 'red',\n  main = ''\n)\nlegend(\n  'topright', \n  c('Predicted', 'Actual'),\n  col = c('black', 'red'),\n  lwd = 1\n)\ntitle( main = \"Predictive check - Orig/dest FE Poisson model\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHard to tell any noticeable difference, right? To see if there is any, we can have a look at the estimates obtained:\n\nsummary(m4)$coefficients['street_dist', ]\n\n      Estimate     Std. Error        z value       Pr(&gt;|z|) \n -9.961619e-02   2.688731e-03  -3.704952e+01  1.828096e-300 \n\n\nAnd compare this to that of the straight distances in the previous model:\n\nsummary(m3)$coefficients['straight_dist', ]\n\n      Estimate     Std. Error        z value       Pr(&gt;|z|) \n -7.820014e-02   2.683052e-03  -2.914596e+01  9.399407e-187 \n\n\nAs we can see, the differences exist but they are not massive. Let’s use this example to learn how to interpret coefficients in a Poisson model8. Effectively, these estimates can be understood as multiplicative effects. Since our model fits\n8 See section 6.2 of Gelman and Hill (2006) for a similar treatment of these.\\[\nT_{ij} \\sim Poisson (\\exp^{X_{ij}\\beta})\n\\]\nwe need to transform \\(\\beta\\) through an exponential in order to get a sense of the effect of distance on the number of trips. This means that for the street distance, our original estimate is \\(\\beta_{street} = -0.0996\\), but this needs to be translated through the exponential into \\(e^{-0.0996} = 0.906\\). In other words, since distance is expressed in standard deviations9, we can expect a 10% decrease in the number of trips for an increase of one standard deviation (about 1Km) in the distance between the stations. This can be compared with \\(e^{-0.0782} = 0.925\\) for the straight distances, or a reduction of about 8% the number of trips for every increase of a standard deviation (about 720m).\n9 Remember the transformation at the very beginning.",

    "text": "5.5 Predicting flows\nSo far we have put all of our modeling efforts in understanding the model we fit and improving such model so it fits our data as closely as possible. This is essential in any modelling exercise but should be far from a stopping point. Once we’re confident our model is a decent representation of the data generating process, we can start exploiting it. In this section, we will cover one specific case that showcases how a fitted model can help: out-of-sample forecasts.\nIt is August 2015, and you have just started working as a data scientist for the bikeshare company that runs the San Francisco system. You join them as they’re planning for the next academic year and, in order to plan their operations (re-allocating vans, station maintenance, etc.), they need to get a sense of how many people are going to be pedalling across the city and, crucially, where they are going to be pedalling through. What can you do to help them?\nThe easiest approach is to say “well, a good guess for how many people will be going between two given stations this coming year is how many went through last year, isn’t it?”. This is one prediction approach. However, you could see how, even if the same process governs over both datasets (2015 and 2016), each year will probably have some idiosyncracies and thus looking too closely into one year might not give the best possible answer for the next one. Ideally, you want a good stylized synthesis that captures the bits that stay constant over time and thus can be applied in the future and that ignores those aspects that are too particular to a given point in time. That is the rationale behind using a fitted model to obtain predictions.\nHowever good any theory though, the truth is in the pudding. So, to see if a modeling approach is better at producing forecasts than just using the counts from last year, we can put them to a test. The way this is done when evaluating the predictive performance of a model (as this is called in the literature) relies on two basic steps: a) obtain predictions from a given model and b) compare those to the actual values (in our case, with the counts for 2016 in trips16) and get a sense of “how off” they are. We have essentially covered a) above; for b), there are several measures to use. We will use one of the most common ones, the root mean squared error (RMSE), which roughly gives a sense of the average difference between a predicted vector and the real deal:\n\\[\nRMSE = \\sqrt{ \\sum_{ij} (\\hat{T_{ij}} - T_{ij})^2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{T_{ij}}\\) is the predicted amount of trips between stations \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). RMSE is straightforward in R and, since we will use it a couple of times, let’s write a short function to make our lives easier:\n\nrmse &lt;- function(t, p){\n  se &lt;- (t - p)^2\n  mse &lt;- mean(se)\n  rmse &lt;- sqrt(mse)\n  return(rmse)\n}\n\nwhere t stands for the vector of true values, and p is the vector of predictions. Let’s give it a spin to make sure it works:\n\nrmse_m4 &lt;- rmse(db_std$trips16, m4$fitted.values)\nrmse_m4\n\n[1] 256.2197\n\n\nThat means that, on average, predictions in our best model m4 are 256 trips off. Is this good? Bad? Worse? It’s hard to say but, being practical, what we can say is whether this better than our alternative. Let us have a look at the RMSE of the other models as well as that of simply plugging in last year’s counts:[^05-flows-11]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\nCan you create a single plot that displays the distribution of the predicted values of the five different ways to predict trips in 2016 and the actual counts of trips?\n\n\n\n\nrmses &lt;- data.frame(\n  model=c(\n    'OLS', \n    'Poisson', \n    'Poisson + FE', \n    'Poisson + FE + street dist.',\n    'Trips-2015'\n  ),\n  RMSE=c(\n  rmse(db_std$trips16, m1$fitted.values),\n  rmse(db_std$trips16, m2$fitted.values),\n  rmse(db_std$trips16, m3$fitted.values),\n  rmse(db_std$trips16, m4$fitted.values),\n  rmse(db_std$trips16, db_std$trips15)\n  )\n)\nrmses\n\n                        model     RMSE\n1                         OLS 323.6135\n2                     Poisson 320.8962\n3                Poisson + FE 254.4468\n4 Poisson + FE + street dist. 256.2197\n5                  Trips-2015 131.0228\n\n\nThe table is both encouraging and disheartning at the same time. On the one hand, all the modeling techniques covered above behave as we would expect: the baseline model displays the worst predicting power of all, and every improvement (except the street distances!) results in notable decreases of the RMSE. This is good news. However, on the other hand, all of our modelling efforts fall short of given a better guess than simply using the previous year’s counts. Why? Does this mean that we should not pay attention to modeling and inference? Not really. Generally speaking, a model is as good at predicting as it is able to mimic the underlying process that gave rise to the data in the first place. The results above point to a case where our model is not picking up all the factors that determine the amount of trips undertaken in a give route. This could be improved by enriching the model with more/better predictors, as we have seen above. Also, the example above seems to point to a case where those idiosyncracies in 2015 that the model does not pick up seem to be at work in 2016 as well. This is great news for our prediction efforts this time, but we have no idea why this is the case and, for all that matters, it could change the coming year. Besides the elegant quantification of uncertainty, the true advantage of a modeling approach in this context is that, if well fit, it is able to pick up the fundamentals that apply over and over. This means that, if next year we’re not as lucky as this one and previous counts are not good predictors but the variables we used in our model continue to have a role in determining the outcome, the data scientist should be luckier and hit a better prediction.",

    "section": "\n6.3 Non-spatial regression",
    "text": "6.3 Non-spatial regression\nBefore we discuss how to explicitly include space into the linear regression framework, let us fit a linear regression model and interpret the results. We may want to explain the price of a property advertised on AirBnb as a function of some of its characteristics, such as the number of people it accommodates, and how many bathrooms, bedrooms and beds it features. At the individual level, we can express this as:\n\\[\n\\log(P_i) = \\alpha + \\beta_1 Acc_i + \\beta_2 Bath_i + \\beta_3 Bedr_i + \\beta_4 Beds_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nwhere \\(P_i\\) is the price of house \\(i\\), \\(Acc_i\\), \\(Bath_i\\), \\(Bedr_i\\) and \\(Beds_i\\) are the count of people it accommodates, bathrooms, bedrooms and beds that house \\(i\\) has, respectively. The parameters \\(\\beta_{1,2, 3, 4}\\) give us information about in which way and to what extent each variable is related to the price, and \\(\\alpha\\), the constant term, is the average house price when all the other variables are zero. The term \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is usually referred to as the “error” and captures elements that influence the price of a house but are not accounted for explicitly. We can also express this relation in matrix form, excluding subindices for \\(i\\) as:\n\\[\n\\log(P) = \\alpha + \\beta_1 Acc + \\beta_2 Bath + \\beta_3 Bedr + \\beta_4 Beds + \\epsilon\n\\] where each term can be interpreted in terms of vectors instead of scalars (wit the exception of the parameters \\((\\alpha, \\beta_{1, 2, 3, 4})\\), which are scalars). Note we are using the logarithm of the price, since this allows us to interpret the coefficients as roughly the percentage change induced by a unit increase in the explanatory variable of the estimate.\nRemember a regression can be seen as a multivariate extension of bivariate correlations. Indeed, one way to interpret the \\(\\beta_k\\) coefficients in the equation above is as the degree of correlation between the explanatory variable \\(k\\) and the dependent variable, keeping all the other explanatory variables constant. When you calculate simple bivariate correlations, the coefficient of a variable is picking up the correlation between the variables, but it is also subsuming into it variation associated with other correlated variables –also called confounding factors. Regression allows you to isolate the distinct effect that a single variable has on the dependent one, once we control for those other variables.\nAssume that new houses tend to be built more often in areas with low deprivation. If that is the case, then \\(NEW\\) and \\(IMD\\) will be correlated with each other (as well as with the price of a house, as we are hypothesizing in this case). If we calculate a simple correlation between \\(P\\) and \\(IMD\\), the coefficient will represent the degree of association between both variables, but it will also include some of the association between \\(IMD\\) and \\(NEW\\). That is, part of the obtained correlation coefficient will be due not to the fact that higher prices tend to be found in areas with low IMD, but to the fact that new houses tend to be more expensive. This is because (in this example) new houses tend to be built in areas with low deprivation and simple bivariate correlation cannot account for that.\nWe first fit the model specified in the equation above by running:\n\nm1 &lt;- lm('log_price ~ accommodates + bathrooms + bedrooms + beds', db)\n\nWe use the command lm, for linear model, and specify the equation we want to fit using a string that relates the dependent variable (the log of the price, log_price) with a set of explanatory ones (accommodates, bathrooms, bedrooms, beds) by using a tilde ~ that is akin to the \\(=\\) symbol in the mathematical equation above. Since we are using names of variables that are stored in a table, we need to pass the table object (db) as well.\nIn order to inspect the results of the model, the quickest way is to call summary:\n\nsummary(m1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = \"log_price ~ accommodates + bathrooms + bedrooms + beds\", \n    data = db)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.8486 -0.3234 -0.0095  0.3023  3.3975 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

This is concentrated on the Coefficients section, which gives us the estimates for the \\(\\beta_k\\) coefficients in our model. These estimates are the raw equivalent of the correlation coefficient between each explanatory variable and the dependent one, once the “polluting” effect of the other variables included in the model has been accounted for1. Results are as expected for the most part: houses tend to be significantly more expensive if they accommodate more people (an extra person increases the price by 17.7%, approximately), have more bathrooms (15.1%), or bedrooms (11.2%). Perhaps counter intuitively, an extra bed available seems to decrease the price by about -7.7%. However, keep in mind that this is the case, everything else equal. Hence, more beds per room and bathroom (ie. a more crowded house) is a bit cheaper.\n1 Keep in mind that regression is no magic. We are only discounting the effect of other confounding factors that we include in the model, not of all potentially confounding factors.",

    "text": "6.4 Spatial regression\nSpatial regression is about explicitly introducing space or geographical context into the statistical framework of a regression. Conceptually, we want to introduce space into our model whenever we think it plays an important role in the process we are interested in, or when space can act as a reasonable proxy for other factors we cannot but should include in our model. As an example of the former, we can imagine how houses at the seafront are probably more expensive than those in the second row, given their better views. To illustrate the latter, we can think of how the character of a neighborhood is important in determining the price of a house; however, it is very hard to identify and quantify “character” per se, although it might be easier to get at its spatial variation, hence a case of space as a proxy.\nSpatial regression is a large field of development in the econometrics and statistics literature. In this brief introduction, we will consider two related but very different processes that give rise to spatial effects: spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence.

    "text": "6.5 Spatial heterogeneity\nSpatial heterogeneity (SH) arises when we cannot safely assume the process we are studying operates under the same “rules” throughout the geography of interest. In other words, we can observe SH when there are effects on the outcome variable that are intrinsically linked to specific locations. A good example of this is the case of seafront houses above: we are trying to model the price of a house and, the fact some houses are located under certain conditions (i.e. by the sea), makes their price behave differently. This somewhat abstract concept of SH can be made operational in a model in several ways. We will explore the following two: spatial fixed-effects (FE); and spatial regimes, which is a generalization of FE.\nSpatial FE\nLet us consider the house price example from the previous section to introduce a more general illustration that relates to the second motivation for spatial effects (“space as a proxy”). Given we are only including two explanatory variables in the model, it is likely we are missing some important factors that play a role at determining the price at which a house is sold. Some of them, however, are likely to vary systematically over space (e.g. different neighborhood characteristics). If that is the case, we can control for those unobserved factors by using traditional dummy variables but basing their creation on a spatial rule. For example, let us include a binary variable for every neighbourhood, as provided by AirBnB, indicating whether a given house is located within such area (1) or not (0).

In our particular case, estimating spatial FE in our particular example also gives you an indirect measure of area desirability: since they are simple dummies in a regression explaining the price of a house, their estimate tells us about how much people are willing to pay to live in a given area. We can visualise this “geography of desirability” by plotting the estimates of each fixed effect on a map:\n\n# Extract neighborhood names from coefficients\nnei.names &lt;- m2$coefficients %&gt;%\n  as.data.frame() %&gt;%\n  row.names() %&gt;%\n  str_replace(\"neighborhood\", \"\")\n# Set up as Data Frame\nnei.fes &lt;- data.frame(\n  coef = m2$coefficients,\n  nei = nei.names,\n  row.names = nei.names\n) %&gt;%\n  right_join(\n    db, by = c(\"nei\" = \"neighborhood\")\n)\n# Plot\nnei.fes %&gt;%\n  st_as_sf() %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(color = coef)) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  scale_color_viridis_c() +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see how neighborhoods in the left (west) tend to have higher prices. What we cannot see, but it is represented there if you are familiar with the geography of San Diego, is that the city is bounded by the Pacific ocean on the left, suggesting neighbourhoods by the beach tend to be more expensive.\nRemember that the interpretation of a \\(\\beta_k\\) coefficient is the effect of variable \\(k\\), given all the other explanatory variables included remained constant. By including a single variable for each area, we are effectively forcing the model to compare as equal only house prices that share the same value for each variable; that is, only houses located within the same area. Introducing FE affords you a higher degree of isolation of the effects of the variables you introduce in your model because you can control for unobserved effects that align spatially with the distribution of the FE you introduce (by neighbourhood, in our case).\nSpatial regimes\nAt the core of estimating spatial FEs is the idea that, instead of assuming the dependent variable behaves uniformly over space, there are systematic effects following a geographical pattern that affect its behaviour. In other words, spatial FEs introduce econometrically the notion of spatial heterogeneity. They do this in the simplest possible form: by allowing the constant term to vary geographically. The other elements of the regression are left untouched and hence apply uniformly across space. The idea of spatial regimes (SRs) is to generalize the spatial FE approach to allow not only the constant term to vary but also any other explanatory variable. This implies that the equation we will be estimating is: \\[\\log(P_i) = \\alpha_r + \\beta_{1r} Acc_i + \\beta_{2r} Bath_i + \\beta_{3r} Bedr_i + \\beta_{4r} Beds_i + \\epsilon_i\\]\nwhere we are not only allowing the constant term to vary by region (\\(\\alpha_r\\)), but also every other parameter (\\(\\beta_{kr}\\)).\nAlso, given we are going to allow every coefficient to vary by regime, we will need to explicitly set a constant term that we can allow to vary:\n\ndb$one &lt;- 1\n\nThen, the estimation leverages the capabilities in model description of R formulas:\n\n# `:` notation implies interaction variables\nm3 &lt;- lm(\n  'log_price ~ (one + accommodates + bathrooms + bedrooms + beds):(neighborhood)', \n  db\n)\nsummary(m3)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = \"log_price ~ (one + accommodates + bathrooms + bedrooms + beds):(neighborhood)\", \n    data = db)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.5528 -0.2921 -0.0163  0.2586  3.1874 \n\nCoefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities)\n                                                  Estimate Std.

    "text": "6.6 Spatial dependence\nAs we have just discussed, SH is about effects of phenomena that are explicitly linked to geography and that hence cause spatial variation and clustering of values. This encompasses many of the kinds of spatial effects we may be interested in when we fit linear regressions. However, in other cases, our interest is on the effect of the spatial configuration of the observations, and the extent to which that has an effect on the outcome we are considering. For example, we might think that the price of a house not only depends on the number of bathrooms it has but, if we take number of bathrooms as a proxy for size and status, also whether it is surrounded by other houses with many bathrooms. This kind of spatial effect is fundamentally different from SH in that is it not related to inherent characteristics of the geography but relates to the characteristics of the observations in our dataset and, specially, to their spatial arrangement. We call this phenomenon by which the values of observations are related to each other through distance spatial dependence (Anselin 1988).\nSpatial Weights\nThere are several ways to introduce spatial dependence in an econometric framework, with varying degrees of econometric sophistication (see Anselin 2003 for a good overview). Common to all of them however is the way space is formally encapsulated: through spatial weights matrices (\\(W\\))2 These are \\(NxN\\) matrices with zero diagonals and every \\(w_{ij}\\) cell with a value that represents the degree of spatial connectivity/interaction between observations \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). If they are not connected at all, \\(w_{ij}=0\\), otherwise \\(w_{ij}&gt;0\\) and we call \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) neighbors. The exact value in the latter case depends on the criterium we use to define neighborhood relations. These matrices also tend to be row-standardized so the sum of each row equals to one.\n2 If you need to refresh your knowledge on spatial weight matrices. Block E of Arribas-Bel (2019) Chapter 4 of Rey, Arribas-Bel, and Wolf (2023) provide a good explanation of theory around spatial weights and the Spatial Weights Section of Rowe (2022) illustrates the use of R to compute different types of spatial weight matrices.A related concept to spatial weight matrices is that of spatial lag. This is an operator that multiplies a given variable \\(y\\) by a spatial weight matrix:\n\\[\ny_{lag} = W y\n\\]\nIf \\(W\\) is row-standardized, \\(y_{lag}\\) is effectively the average value of \\(y\\) in the neighborhood of each observation. The individual notation may help clarify this:\n\\[\ny_{lag-i} = \\displaystyle \\sum_j w_{ij} y_j\n\\]\nwhere \\(y_{lag-i}\\) is the spatial lag of variable \\(y\\) at location \\(i\\), and \\(j\\) sums over the entire dataset. If \\(W\\) is row-standardized, \\(y_{lag-i}\\) becomes an average of \\(y\\) weighted by the spatial criterium defined in \\(W\\).\nGiven that spatial weights matrices are not the focus of this tutorial, we will stick to a very simple case. Since we are dealing with points, we will use \\(K\\)-nn weights, which take the \\(k\\) nearest neighbors of each observation as neighbors and assign a value of one, assigning everyone else a zero. We will use \\(k=50\\) to get a good degree of variation and sensible results.\n\n# Create knn list of each house\nhnn &lt;- db %&gt;%\n  st_coordinates() %&gt;%\n  as.matrix() %&gt;%\n  knearneigh(k = 50)\n# Create nb object\nhnb &lt;- knn2nb(hnn)\n# Create spatial weights matrix (note it row-standardizes by default)\nhknn &lt;- nb2listw(hnb)\n\nWe can inspect the weights created by simply typing the name of the object:\n\nhknn\n\nCharacteristics of weights list object:\nNeighbour list object:\nNumber of regions: 6110 \nNumber of nonzero links: 305500 \nPercentage nonzero weights: 0.8183306 \nAverage number of links: 50 \nNon-symmetric neighbours list\n\nWeights style: W \nWeights constants summary:\n     n       nn   S0       S1       S2\nW 6110 37332100 6110 220.5032 24924.44\n\n\nExogenous spatial effects\nLet us come back to the house price example we have been working with. So far, we have hypothesised that the price of an AirBnb property in San Diego can be explained using information about its own characteristics, and the neighbourhood it belongs to. However, we can hypothesise that the price of a house is also affected by the characteristics of the houses surrounding it. Considering it as a proxy for larger and more luxurious houses, we will use the number of bathrooms of neighboring houses as an additional explanatory variable. This represents the most straightforward way to introduce spatial dependence in a regression, by considering not only a given explanatory variable, but also its spatial lag.\nIn our example case, in addition to including the number of bathrooms of the property, we will include its spatial lag. In other words, we will be saying that it is not only the number of bathrooms in a house but also that of the surrounding properties that helps explain the final price at which a house is advertised for. Mathematically, this implies estimating the following model:\n\\[\n\\log(P_i) = \\alpha + \\beta_1 Acc_i + \\beta_2 Bath_i + \\beta_3 Bedr_i + \\beta_4 Beds_i+ \\beta_5 Bath_{lag-i} + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nLet us first compute the spatial lag of bathrooms:\n\ndb$w_bathrooms &lt;- lag.listw(hknn, db$bathrooms)\n\nAnd then we can include it in our previous specification. Note that we apply the log to the lag, not the reverse:\n\nm5 &lt;- lm(\n  'log_price ~ accommodates + bedrooms + beds + bathrooms + w_bathrooms',\n  db\n)\n\nsummary(m5)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = \"log_price ~ accommodates + bedrooms + beds + bathrooms + w_bathrooms\", \n    data = db)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.8869 -0.3243 -0.0206  0.2931  3.5132 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

Taken literally, this implies that the average number of bathrooms in AirBnb’s nearby has a larger effect on the final price of a given AirBnb than its own number of bathrooms. There are several ways to interpret this. One is that, if we take the spatial lag of bathrooms, as we said above, to be a proxy for the types of houses surrounding a property, this is probably a better predictor of how wealthy an area is than the number of bathrooms of a single property, which is more variable. If we also assume that the area where an AirBnb is located has a bigger effect on price than the number of bathrooms, we can start seeing an answer to the apparent puzzle.\nA note on more advanced spatial regression\nIntroducing a spatial lag of an explanatory variable, as we have just seen, is the most straightforward way of incorporating the notion of spatial dependence in a linear regression framework. It does not require additional changes, it can be estimated with OLS, and the interpretation is rather similar to interpreting non-spatial variables. The field of spatial econometrics however is a much broader one and has produced over the last decades many techniques to deal with spatial effects and spatial dependence in different ways. Although this might be an over simplification, one can say that most of such efforts for the case of a single cross-section are focused on two main variations: the spatial lag and the spatial error model. Both are similar to the case we have seen in that they are based on the introduction of a spatial lag, but they differ in the component of the model they modify and affect.\nThe spatial lag model introduces a spatial lag of the dependent variable. In the example we have covered, this would translate into:\n\\[\n\\log(P_i) = \\alpha + \\rho \\log(P_i) + \\beta_1 Acc_i + \\beta_2 Bath_i + \\beta_3 Bedr_i + \\beta_4 Beds_i + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nAlthough it might not seem very different from the previous equation, this model violates the exogeneity assumption, crucial for OLS to work.\nEqually, the spatial error model includes a spatial lag in the error term of the equation:\n\\[\n\\log(P_i) = \\alpha + \\beta_1 Acc_i + \\beta_2 Bath_i + \\beta_3 Bedr_i + \\beta_4 Beds_i + u_i\n\\]\n\\[\nu_i = u_{lag-i} + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\nAgain, although similar, one can show this specification violates the assumptions about the error term in a classical OLS model.\nBoth the spatial lag and error model violate some of the assumptions on which OLS relies and thus render the technique unusable. Much of the efforts have thus focused on coming up with alternative methodologies that allow unbiased, robust, and efficient estimation of such models. A survey of those is beyond the scope of this note, but the interested reader is referred to Anselin (1988), Anselin (2003), and Anselin and Rey (2014) for further reference.",

    "text": "6.7 Predicting house prices\nSo far, we have seen how to exploit the output of a regression model to evaluate the role different variables play in explaining another one of interest. However, once fit, a model can also be used to obtain predictions of the dependent variable given a new set of values for the explanatory variables. We will finish this session by dipping our toes in predicting with linear models.\nThe core idea is that once you have estimates for the way in which the explanatory variables can be combined to explain the dependent one, you can plug new values on the explanatory side of the model and combine them following the model estimates to obtain predictions. In the example we have worked with, you can imagine this application would be useful to obtain valuations of a house, given we know its characteristics.\nConceptually, predicting in linear regression models involves using the estimates of the parameters to obtain a value for the dependent variable:\n\\[\n\\log(\\bar{P_i}) = \\bar{\\alpha} + \\bar{\\beta_1} Acc_i^* + \\bar{\\beta_2} Bath_i^* + \\bar{\\beta_3} Bedr_i^* + \\bar{\\beta_4} Beds_i^*\n\\] where \\(\\log(\\bar{P_i})\\) is our predicted value, and we include the bar sign to note that it is our estimate obtained from fitting the model. We use the \\(^*\\) sign to note that those can be new values for the explanatory variables, not necessarily those used to fit the model.\nTechnically speaking, prediction in linear models is relatively streamlined in R. Suppose we are given data for a new house which is to be put on the AirBnb platform. We know it accommodates four people, and has two bedrooms, three beds, and one bathroom. We also know that the surrounding properties have, on average, 1.5 bathrooms. Let us record the data first:\n\nnew.house &lt;- data.frame(\n  accommodates = 4, \n  bedrooms = 2,\n  beds = 3,\n  bathrooms = 1,\n  w_bathrooms = 1.5\n)\n\nTo obtain the prediction for its price, we can use the predict method:\n\nnew.price &lt;- predict(m5, new.house)\nnew.price\n\n       1 \n4.900168 \n\n\nNow remember we were using the log of the price as dependent variable. If we want to recover the actual price of the house, we need to take its exponent:\n\nexp(new.price)\n\n       1 \n134.3123 \n\n\nAccording to our model, the house would be worth $134.3123448.",

Data Structure.\n\nThe data are hierarchically structured: OAs nested within LSOAs; LSOAs nested within MSOAs; and, MSOAs nested within LADs. Observations nested within higher geographical units may be correlated.\nThis is one type of hierarchical structure. There is a range of data structures:\n\nStrict nested data structures eg. an individual unit is nested within only one higher unit\nRepeated measures structures eg. various measurements for an individual unit\nCrossed classified structures eg. individuals may work and live in different neighbourhoods\nMultiple membership structure eg. individuals may have two different work places\n\nWhy should we care about the structure of the data?\n\nDraw correct statistical inference: Failing to recognise hierarchical structures will lead to underestimated standard errors of regression coefficients and an overstatement of statistical significance. Standard errors for the coefficients of higher-level predictor variables will be the most affected by ignoring grouping.\nLink context to individual units: We can link and understand the extent of group effects on individual outcomes eg. how belonging to a certain socio-economic group influences on future career opportunities.\nSpatial dependency: Recognising the hierarchical structure of data may help mitigate the effects of severe spatial autocorrelation.\n\nQuickly, let us get a better idea about the data and look at the number of OAs nested within LSOAs and MSOAs\n\n# mean of nested OAs within LSOAs and MSOAs\nlsoa_cd %&gt;% table() %&gt;%\n  mean() %&gt;%\n  round(, 2)\n\n[1] 5\n\nmsoa_cd %&gt;% table() %&gt;%\n  mean() %&gt;%\n  round(, 2)\n\n[1] 26\n\n# number of OAs nested within LSOAs and MSOAs\nlsoa_cd %&gt;% table() %&gt;%\n  sort() %&gt;%\n  plot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmsoa_cd %&gt;% table() %&gt;%\n  sort() %&gt;%\n  plot()",

Let us now use a simple example to understand the intuition of multilevel model using the census data. We will seek to understand the spatial distribution of the proportion of population in unemployment in Liverpool, particularly why and where concentrations in this proportion occur. To illustrate the advantages of taking a multilevel modelling approach, we will start by estimating a linear regression model and progressively building complexity. We will first estimate a model and then explain the intuition underpinning the process. We will seek to gain a general understanding of multilevel modelling.

But how do we deal with the hierarchical structure of the data?\n\n7.3.1.1 Limitations\nBefore looking at the answer, let’s first understand some of the key limitations of the linear regression model to handle the hierarchical structure of data. A key limitation of the linear regression model is that it only captures average relationships in the data. It does not capture variations in the relationship between variables across areas or groups. Another key limitation is that the linear regression model can capture associations at either macro or micro levels, but it does not simultaneously measure their interdependencies.\nTo illustrate this, let us consider the regression intercept. It indicates that the average percentage of unemployed population at the OA level is 0.12 but this model ignores any spatial clustering ie. the percentage of unemployed population tends to be similar across OAs nested within a same LSOA or MSOA. A side effect of ignoring this is that our standard errors are biased, and thus claims about statistical significance based on them would be misleading. Additionally, this situation also means we cannot explore variations in the percentage of unemployed population across LSOAs or MSOAs ie. how the percentage of unemployed population may be dependent on various contextual factors at these geographical scales.\n\n7.3.1.2 Fixed Effect Approach\nAn alternative approach is to adopt a fixed effects approach, or no-pooling model; that is, adding dummy variables indicating the group classification into the regression model eg. the way OAs is nested within LSOAs (or MSOAs). This approach has limitations. First, there is high risk of overfitting. The number of groups may be too large, relative to the number of observations. Second, the estimation of multiple parameters may be required so that measuring differences between groups may be challenging. Third, a fixed effects approach does not allow including group-level explanatory variables. You can try fitting a linear regression model extending our estimated model to include dummy variables for individual LSOAs (and/or MSOAs) so you can compare this to the multilevel model below.\nAn alternative is fitting separate linear regression models for each group. This approach is not always possible if there are groups with small sizes.",

    "text": "7.4 Multilevel Modelling: Random Intercept Model\nWe use multilevel modelling to account for the hierarchical nature of the data by explicitly recognising that OAs are nested within LSOAs and MSOAs. Multilevel models can easily be estimated using in R using the package lme4. We implement an two-level model to allow for variation across LSOAs. We estimate an only intercept model allowing for variation across LSOAs. In essence, we are estimating a model with varying intercept coefficient by LSOA. As you can see in the code chunk below, the equation has an additional component. This is the group component or LSOA effect. The (1 | lsoa_cd) means that we are allowing the intercept, represented by 1, to vary by LSOA.\n\n# specify a model equation\neq2 &lt;- unemp ~ 1 + (1 | lsoa_cd)\nmodel2 &lt;- lmer(eq2, data = oa_shp)\n\n# estimates\nsummary(model2)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: unemp ~ 1 + (1 | lsoa_cd)\n   Data: oa_shp\n\nREML criterion at convergence: -4382.6\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.8741 -0.5531 -0.1215  0.4055  5.8207 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n lsoa_cd  (Intercept) 0.002701 0.05197 \n Residual             0.002575 0.05074 \nNumber of obs: 1584, groups:  lsoa_cd, 298\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.

In multilevel modelling, these types of models are formally known as nested random effects and they differ from a different set of models known as crossed random effects.\n::: column-margin ::: callout-note A crossed random effect model in our example would be expressed as follows:\nunemp ~ 1 + (1 | lsoa_cd) + (1 | msoa_cd)\n::: ::: column-margin\n\n# specify a model equation\neq3 &lt;- unemp ~ 1 + (1 | msoa_cd/lsoa_cd)\nmodel3 &lt;- lmer(eq3, data = oa_shp)\n\n# estimates\nsummary(model3)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: unemp ~ 1 + (1 | msoa_cd/lsoa_cd)\n   Data: oa_shp\n\nREML criterion at convergence: -4529.3\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.5624 -0.5728 -0.1029  0.4228  6.1363 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups          Name        Variance  Std.Dev.\n lsoa_cd:msoa_cd (Intercept) 0.0007603 0.02757 \n msoa_cd         (Intercept) 0.0020735 0.04554 \n Residual                    0.0025723 0.05072 \nNumber of obs: 1584, groups:  lsoa_cd:msoa_cd, 298; msoa_cd, 61\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.

Their interpretation is as usual. Random effects are the novelty. It is a term in multilevel modelling and refers to varying coefficients i.e. the randomness in the probability of the model for the group-level coefficients. Specifically they relate to estimates of the average variance and standard deviation within groups (i.e. LSOAs or MSOAs). Intiutively, variance and standard deviation indicate the extent to which the intercept, on average, varies by LSOAs and MSOAs.\n\n\nFig. 2. Variation of observations around their level 1 group mean.\n\n\n\nFig. 3. Variation of level 1 group mean around their level 2 group mean.\n\n\n\nFig. 4. Grand mean.\n\nMore formally, we first estimated the simplest regression model which is an intercept-only model and equivalent to the sample mean (i.e. the fixed part of the model):\n\\[y_{ijk} = \\mu + e_{ijk}\\] and then we made the random part of the model (\\(e_{ijk}\\)) more complex to account for the hierarchical structure of the data by estimating the following three-level regression model:\n\\[y_{ijk} = \\mu + u_{i..} + u_{ij.} + e_{ijk}\\]\nwhere \\(y_{ijk}\\) represents the proportion of unemployed population in OA \\(i\\) nested within LSOA \\(j\\) and MSOA \\(k\\); \\(\\mu\\) represents the sample mean and the fixed part of the model; \\(e_{ijk}\\) is the deviation of an observation from its LSOA mean; \\(u_{ij.}\\) is the deviation of the LSOA mean from its MSOA mean; \\(u_{i..}\\) is the deviation of the MSOA mean from the fixed part of the model \\(\\mu\\). Conceptually, this model is decomposing the variance of the model in terms of the hierarchical structure of the data. It is partitioning the observation’s residual into three parts or variance components. These components measure the relative extent of variation of each hierarchical level ie. LSOA, MSOA and grand means. To estimate the set of residuals, they are assumed to follow a normal distribution and are obtained after fitting the model and are based on the estimates of the model parameters (i.e. intercept and variances of the random parameters).\nLet’s now return to our three-level model (reported again below), we see that the intercept or fixed part of the model is the same as for the linear regression. The multilevel model reports greater standard errors. Multilevel models capture the hierarchical structure of the data and thus more precisely estimate the standard errors for our parameters.\n\n# report model 3\nsummary(model3)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: unemp ~ 1 + (1 | msoa_cd/lsoa_cd)\n   Data: oa_shp\n\nREML criterion at convergence: -4529.3\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.5624 -0.5728 -0.1029  0.4228  6.1363 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups          Name        Variance  Std.Dev.\n lsoa_cd:msoa_cd (Intercept) 0.0007603 0.02757 \n msoa_cd         (Intercept) 0.0020735 0.04554 \n Residual                    0.0025723 0.05072 \nNumber of obs: 1584, groups:  lsoa_cd:msoa_cd, 298; msoa_cd, 61\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.

The lsoa_cd:msoa_cd, msoa_cd and Residual estimates indicate that the extent of estimated LSOA-, MSOA- and individual-level variance is 0.0007603, 0.0020735 and 0.0025723, respectively.\n\n7.4.2 Variance Partition Coefficient (VPC)\nThe purpose of multilevel models is to partition variance in the outcome between the different groupings in the data. We thus often want to know the percentage of variation in the dependent variable accounted by differences across groups i.e. what proportion of the total variance is attributable to variation within-groups, or how much is found between-groups. The statistic to obtain this is termed the variance partition coefficient (VPC), or intraclass correlation.2 For our case, the VPC at the MSOA level indicates that 38% of the variation in percentage of unemployed resident population across OAs can be explained by differences across MSOAs.\n2 The VPC is equal to the intra-class correlation coefficient which is the correlation between the observations of the dependent variable selected randomly from the same group. For instance, if the VPC is 0.1, we would say that 10% of the variation is between groups and 90% within. The correlation between randomly chosen pairs of observations belonging to the same group is 0.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask What is the VPC at the LSOA level?\n\n\n\n\n\nvpc_msoa &lt;- 0.0020735 / (0.0007603 + 0.0020735 + 0.0025723)\nvpc_msoa * 100\n\n[1] 38.35482\n\n\nYou can also obtain the VPC by executing:\n\nsumm(model3)\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n1584\n\n\nDependent variable\nunemp\n\n\nType\nMixed effects linear regression\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAIC\n-4521.26\n\n\nBIC\n-4499.79\n\n\nPseudo-R² (fixed effects)\n0.00\n\n\nPseudo-R² (total)\n0.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed Effects\n\n\n\n\nEst.\nS.E.\nt val.\nd.f.\np\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.12\n0.01\n18.63\n59.98\n0.00\n\n\n\n p values calculated using Kenward-Roger standard errors and d.f.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom Effects\n\n\n\nGroup\nParameter\nStd.

These explanations mainly refer to the complexity of dealing with varying sample sizes at a given hierarchical level. The number of observations at each hierarchical level varies across individual groupings (i.e. LSOA or MSOA). It may even be one single observation. This has implications for the distributional assumptions, denominator degrees of freedom and how to approximate a “best” solution. Various approaches exist to compute the statistical significance of estimates.

To visualise the estimated model within each group (ie. LSOA and MSOA), we type:\n\ncoef_m3 &lt;- coef(model3)\nhead(coef_m3$lsoa_cd,5)\n\n                    (Intercept)\nE01006512:E02001377  0.09915456\nE01006513:E02006932  0.09889615\nE01006514:E02001383  0.09297051\nE01006515:E02001383  0.09803754\nE01006518:E02001390  0.09642939\n\n\nThe results indicate that the estimated regression line is \\(y = 0.09915456\\) for LSOA E01006512 within MSOA E02001377; \\(y = 0.09889615\\) for LSOA E01006513 within MSOA E02006932 and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Try getting the estimated model within each MSOA.\n\n\n\nRandom effects\nWe can look at the estimated group-level (or LSOA-level and MSOA-level) errors; that is, random effects:\n\nranef_m3 &lt;- ranef(model3)\nhead(ranef_m3$lsoa_cd, 5)\n\n                    (Intercept)\nE01006512:E02001377 -0.01613353\nE01006513:E02006932 -0.01639194\nE01006514:E02001383 -0.02231758\nE01006515:E02001383 -0.01725055\nE01006518:E02001390 -0.01885870\n\n\nGroup-level errors indicate how much the intercept is shifted up or down in particular groups (ie. LSOAs or MSOAs). Thus, for example, in LSOA E01006512, the estimated intercept is -0.01613353 lower than average, so that the regression line is (0.1152881 - 0.01613353) = 0.09915457 which is what we observed from the call to coef().\nWe can also obtain group-level errors (random effects) by using a simulation approach, labelled “Empirical Bayes” and discussed here. To this end, we run:\n\n# obtain estimates\nmerTools::REsim(model3) %&gt;% \n  head(10)\n\n         groupFctr             groupID        term         mean       median\n1  lsoa_cd:msoa_cd E01006512:E02001377 (Intercept) -0.017672467 -0.015806783\n2  lsoa_cd:msoa_cd E01006513:E02006932 (Intercept) -0.016100308 -0.017000565\n3  lsoa_cd:msoa_cd E01006514:E02001383 (Intercept) -0.025442989 -0.026267409\n4  lsoa_cd:msoa_cd E01006515:E02001383 (Intercept) -0.018891281 -0.019143435\n5  lsoa_cd:msoa_cd E01006518:E02001390 (Intercept) -0.019148563 -0.018554435\n6  lsoa_cd:msoa_cd E01006519:E02001402 (Intercept) -0.015492272 -0.015722844\n7  lsoa_cd:msoa_cd E01006520:E02001389 (Intercept) -0.025259003 -0.025007573\n8  lsoa_cd:msoa_cd E01006521:E02001398 (Intercept)  0.007955532  0.007993531\n9  lsoa_cd:msoa_cd E01006522:E02001394 (Intercept)  0.017985515  0.019536137\n10 lsoa_cd:msoa_cd E01006523:E02001398 (Intercept)  0.005355117  0.005633975\n            sd\n1  0.018391211\n2  0.019652099\n3  0.019058745\n4  0.020226381\n5  0.019389638\n6  0.009645985\n7  0.019125663\n8  0.020530033\n9  0.018747930\n10 0.018392227\n\n\nThe results contain the estimated mean, median and standard deviation for the intercept within each group (e.g. LSOA). The mean estimates are similar to those obtained from ranef with some small differences due to rounding.\nTo gain an undertanding of the general pattern of the random effects, we can use caterpillar plots via plotREsim - reported below. The plot on the right shows the estimated random effects for each MSOA and their respective interval estimate. Note that random effects are on average zero, represented by the red horizontal line. Intervals that do not include zero are in bold. Also note that the width of the confidence interval depends on the standard error of the respective residual estimate, which is inversely related to the size of the sample. The residuals represent an observation departures from the grand mean, so an observation whose confidence interval does not overlap the line at zero (representing the mean proportion of unemployed population across all areas) is said to differ significantly from the average at the 5% level.\n\n# plot\nplotREsim(REsim(model3)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on the plot on the right, we see MSOAs whose mean proportion of unemployed population, assuming no explanatory variables, is lower than average. These are the dots below the horizontal red line. On the right-hand side of the plot, you will see MSOAs whose mean proportion is higher than average. The MSOAs with the smallest residuals include the districts of Allerton and Hunt Cross, Church, Childwall, Wavertree and Woolton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask What districts do we have at the other extreme?

To explain the logic, we will assume that unemployment is strongly associated to long-term illness. We could expect that long-term illness (lt_ill) will reduce the chances of working and therefore being unemployed. Note that our focus is on the relationship, not on establishing causation. Specifically we want to estimate the relationship between unemployment and long-term illness and we are interested in variations in OA-level unemployment by MSOAs so we will estimate the following two-level model:\nOA-level:\n\\[y_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1}x_{ij} + e_{ij}\\] MSOA-level:\n\\[\\beta_{0j} = \\beta_{0} + u_{0j}\\] Replacing the first equation into the second, we have:\n\\[y_{ij} = (\\beta_{0} + u_{0j}) + \\beta_{1}x_{ij} + e_{ij}\\] where \\(y\\) the proportion of unemployed population in OA \\(i\\) within MSOA \\(j\\); \\(\\beta_{0}\\) is the fixed intercept (averaging over all MSOAs); \\(u_{0j}\\) represents the MSOA-level residuals or random effects; \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(u_{0j}\\) together represent the varying-intercept; \\(\\beta_{1}\\) is the slope coefficient; \\(x_{ij}\\) represents the percentage of long-term illness population; and, \\(e_{ij}\\) is the individual-level residuals.\nWe estimate the model executing:\n\n# change to proportion\noa_shp$lt_ill &lt;- lt_ill/100\n\n# specify a model equation\neq4 &lt;- unemp ~ lt_ill + (1 | msoa_cd)\nmodel4 &lt;- lmer(eq4, data = oa_shp)\n\n# estimates\nsummary(model4)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: unemp ~ lt_ill + (1 | msoa_cd)\n   Data: oa_shp\n\nREML criterion at convergence: -4711.9\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-5.1941 -0.5718 -0.0906  0.4507  5.9393 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n msoa_cd  (Intercept) 0.001421 0.03769 \n Residual             0.002674 0.05171 \nNumber of obs: 1584, groups:  msoa_cd, 61\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.

A set of key factors to consider:\n\n\nDependent Variable: We will seek to explain daily COVID-19 cases, and you will need to make a decision as to:\n\n\nDaily vs cumulative COVID-19 cases. Given that we will be focusing on cross-sectional models (i.e. models for one snapshot), you can focus on modelling daily cases at one specific date or cumulative daily cases over a period of time.\nTime period. You can select the date or period of time that you will focus your analysis on.\nUse risk of COVID-19 infection. The dependent variable should be the risk or rate of COVID-19 infection.\n\nFor example, the risk of COVID-19 infection for the period (i.e. between Dec. 1st, 2020 - January 29th, 2021) comprising the third wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom can be computed as:\n\n# computing cumulative COVID cases for  01/12/2020 - 29/01/2021\nsdf[, 509] &lt;- sdf %&gt;% dplyr::select(\"X2020.12.01\":\"X2021.01.29\") %&gt;% # select COVID cases 01/12/2020 - 29/01/2021\n  mutate(cum_covid = rowSums(across(where(is.numeric)))) %&gt;% # sum daily cases\n  dplyr::select(cum_covid) %&gt;% # select cumulative cases\n   st_set_geometry(., NULL) # set geometry to NULL\n\n# computing risk of infection\nsdf &lt;- sdf %&gt;%  mutate(\n  covid19_r = round((cum_covid / Residents ) * 1000) \n  )\n\n\n\nExplanatory variables:\n\n\nAt least 3. Use at least 3 explanatory variables. There is no maximum limit but consider your model to be parsimonious.\nChoice your set. Select the set of variables you consider appropriate / interesting. Make sure you justify your choice based on evidence and/or theory.\nPercentages / Proportions. Use percentages or proportions to capture the composition of places, rather than numbers of people, households or dwellings. For this, ensure you are using the appropriate denominator.\n\nFor instance, if you want to capture the relationship between cumulative COVID-19 cases and overcrowding, share of elderly population and nonwhite minorities, use the following variables\n\nsdf &lt;- sdf %&gt;% mutate(\n  crowded_hou = Crowded_housing / Households, # share of crowded housing\n  elderly = (Age_85plus) / Residents, # share of population aged 65+\n  ethnic = (Mixed + Indian + Pakistani + Bangladeshi + Chinese + Other_Asian + Black + Other_ethnicity) / Residents, # share of nonwhite population\n)\n\nADVICE: Create a new spatial data frame including only the variables you will analyse. For example:\n\nnsdf &lt;- sdf  %&gt;%  dplyr::select(objectid, \n                         ctyua19cd, \n                         ctyua19nm, \n                         Region, \n                         covid19_r, \n                         crowded_hou, \n                         elderly, \n                         ethnic, \n                         Residents)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, Andrew, and Jennifer Hill. 2006.

    "text": "8.4 Estimating Varying Intercept and Slopes Models\nA way to capture for these group differences in the relationship between unemployment rates and long-term illness is to allow the relevant slope to vary by group (i.e. MSOA).

But, additionally, we also have estimates of standard deviation of the MSOA slopes (0.17154) and correlation between MSOA-level residuals for the intercept and slope (-0.73). While the former measures the extent of average deviation in the slopes across MSOAs, the latter indicates that the intercept and slope MSOA-level residuals are negatively associated; that is, MSOAs with large slopes have relatively smaller intercepts and vice versa. We will come back to this in Section Interpreting Correlations Between Group-level Intercepts and Slopes.\nSimilarly, the correlation of fixed effects indicates a negative relationship between the intercept and slope of the average regression model; that is, as the average model intercept tends to increase, the average strength of the relationship between unemployment rate and long-term illness decreases and vice versa.\nWe then explore the estimated average coefficients (fixed effects):\n\nfixef(model6)\n\n(Intercept)      lt_ill \n 0.04765009  0.30125875 \n\n\nyields an estimated regression line in an average LSOA: \\(y = 0.04764998 + 0.30125916x\\). The fixed intercept indicates that the average unemployment rate is 0.05 if the percentage of population with long-term illness is zero.The fixed slope indicates that the average relationship between unemployment rate and long-term illness is positive across MSOAs i.e. as the percentage of population with long-term illness increases by 1 percentage point, the unemployment rate increases by 0.3.\nWe look the estimated MSOA-level errors (random effects):\n\nranef_m6 &lt;- ranef(model6)\nhead(ranef_m6$msoa_cd, 5)\n\n           (Intercept)      lt_ill\nE02001347 -0.026561345  0.02718102\nE02001348  0.001688245 -0.11533102\nE02001349 -0.036084817  0.05547075\nE02001350  0.032240842 -0.14298734\nE02001351  0.086214137 -0.28130162\n\n\nRecall these estimates indicate the extent of deviation of the MSOA-specific intercept and slope from the estimated model average captured by the fixed model component.\nWe can also regain the estimated intercept and slope for each county by adding the estimated MSOA-level errors to the estimated average coefficients; or by executing:\n\n#coef(model6)\n\nWe are normally more interested in identifying the extent of deviation and its significance. To this end, we create a caterpillar plot:\n\n# plot\nplotREsim(REsim(model6))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots reveal some interesting patterns. First, only one MSOA, containing wards such as Tuebrook and Stoneycroft, Anfield & Everton, seems to have a statistically significantly different intercept, or average unemployment rate. Confidence intervals overlap zero for all other 60 MSOAs. Despite this, note that when a slope is allowed to vary by group, it generally makes sense for the intercept to also vary. Second, significant variability exists in the association between unemployment rate and long-term illness across MSOAs. Ten MSOAs display a significant positive association, while 12 exhibit a significantly negative relationship. Third, these results reveal that geographical differences in the relationship between unemployment rate and long-term illness can explain the significant differences in average unemployment rates in the varying intercept only model.\nLet’s try to get a better understanding of the varying relationship between unemployment rate and long-term illness by mapping the relevant MSOA-level errors.\n\n# read data\nmsoa_shp &lt;- st_read(\"data/mlm/MSOA.shp\")\n\nReading layer `MSOA' from data source \n  `/Users/franciscorowe/Dropbox/Francisco/uol/teaching/envs453/202324/san/data/mlm/MSOA.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 61 features and 17 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 333086.1 ymin: 381426.3 xmax: 345636 ymax: 397980.1\nProjected CRS: Transverse_Mercator\n\n# create a dataframe for MSOA-level random effects\nre_msoa_m6 &lt;- REsim(model6) %&gt;% filter(groupFctr == \"msoa_cd\") %&gt;%\n  filter(term == \"lt_ill\")\nstr(re_msoa_m6)\n\n'data.frame':   61 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ groupFctr: chr  \"msoa_cd\" \"msoa_cd\" \"msoa_cd\" \"msoa_cd\" ...\n $ groupID  : chr  \"E02001347\" \"E02001348\" \"E02001349\" \"E02001350\" ...\n $ term     : chr  \"lt_ill\" \"lt_ill\" \"lt_ill\" \"lt_ill\" ...\n $ mean     : num  0.0229 -0.111 0.0609 -0.1436 -0.2818 ...\n $ median   : num  0.0249 -0.1176 0.0553 -0.1416 -0.285 ...\n $ sd       : num  0.0443 0.0698 0.0776 0.0413 0.038 ...\n\n# merge data\nmsoa_shp &lt;- merge(x = msoa_shp, y = re_msoa_m6, by.x = \"MSOA_CD\", by.y = \"groupID\")\n\n\n# ensure geometry is valid\nmsoa_shp = sf::st_make_valid(msoa_shp)\n\n# create a map\nlegend_title = expression(\"MSOA-level residuals\")\nmap_msoa = tm_shape(msoa_shp) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"median\", title = legend_title, palette = magma(256, begin = 0, end = 1), style = \"cont\") + \n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .01)  + \n  tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\") , size = 4) + \n  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0,1,2), text.size = 0.5, position =  c(\"center\", \"bottom\")) \nmap_msoa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map indicates that the relationship between unemployment rate and long-term illness is tends to stronger and positive in northern MSOAs; that is, the percentage of population with long-term illness explains a greater share of the variation in unemployment rates in these locations. As expected, a greater share of population in long-term illness is associated with higher local unemployment. In contrast, the relationship between unemployment rate and long-term illness tends to operate in the reverse direction in north-east and middle-southern MSOAs. In these MSOAs, OAs tend to have a higher unemployment rate relative the share of population in long-term illness.

    "text": "8.5 Interpreting Correlations Between Group-level Intercepts and Slopes\nCorrelations of random effects are confusing to interpret. Key for their appropriate interpretation is to recall they refer to group-level residuals i.e. deviation of intercepts and slopes from the average model intercept and slope. A strong negative correlation indicates that groups with high intercepts have relatively low slopes, and vice versa. A strong positive correlation indicates that groups with high intercepts have relatively high slopes, and vice versa. A correlation close to zero indicate little or no systematic between intercepts and slopes. Note that a high correlation between intercepts and slopes is not a problem, but it makes the interpretation of the estimated intercepts more challenging. For this reason, a suggestion is to center predictors (\\(x's\\)); that is, substract their average value (\\(z = x - \\bar{x}\\)). For a more detailed discussion, see Multilevel Modelling (n.d.).\nTo illustrate this, let’s reestimate our model adding an individual-level predictor: the share of population with no educational qualification.\n\n# centering to the mean\noa_shp$z_no_qual &lt;- no_qual/100 - mean(no_qual/100)\noa_shp$z_lt_ill &lt;- lt_ill - mean(lt_ill)\n\n# specify a model equation\neq7 &lt;- unemp ~ z_lt_ill + z_no_qual + (1 + z_lt_ill | msoa_cd)\nmodel7 &lt;- lmer(eq7, data = oa_shp)\n\n# estimates\nsummary(model7)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: unemp ~ z_lt_ill + z_no_qual + (1 + z_lt_ill | msoa_cd)\n   Data: oa_shp\n\nREML criterion at convergence: -4940.7\n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.6830 -0.5949 -0.0868  0.4631  6.3556 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance  Std.Dev.

    "text": "8.6 Model building\nNow we know how to estimate multilevel regression models in R. The question that remains is: When does multilevel modeling make a difference? The short answer is: when there is little group-level variation. When there is very little group-level variation, the multilevel modelling reduces to classical linear regression estimates with no group indicators. Inversely, when group-level coefficients vary greatly (compared to their standard errors of estimation), multilevel modelling reduces to classical regression with group indicators Gelman and Hill (2006).\nHow do you go about building a model?\nWe generally start simple by fitting simple linear regressions and then work our way up to a full multilevel model - see Gelman and Hill (2006) p. 270.\nHow many groups are needed?\nAs an absolute minimum, more than two groups are required. With only one or two groups, a multilevel model reduces to a linear regression model.\nHow many observations per group?\nTwo observations per group is sufficient to fit a multilevel model.\n\n8.6.1 Model Comparison\nHow we assess different candidate models? We can use the function anova() and assess various statistics: The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Loglik and Deviance. Generally, we look for lower scores for all these indicators. We can also refer to the Chisq statistic below. It tests the hypothesis of whether additional predictors improve model fit. Particularly it tests the Null Hypothesis whether the coefficients of the additional predictors equal 0. It does so comparing the deviance statistic and determining if changes in the deviance are statistically significant. Note that a major limitation of the deviance test is that it is for nested models i.e. a model being compared must be nested in the other. Below we compare our two models. The results indicate that adding an individual-level predictor (i.e. the share of population with no qualification) provides a model with better.\n\nanova(model6, model7)\n\nrefitting model(s) with ML (instead of REML)\n\n\nData: oa_shp\nModels:\nmodel6: unemp ~ lt_ill + (1 + lt_ill | msoa_cd)\nmodel7: unemp ~ z_lt_ill + z_no_qual + (1 + z_lt_ill | msoa_cd)\n       npar     AIC     BIC logLik deviance  Chisq Df Pr(&gt;Chisq)    \nmodel6    6 -4764.7 -4732.5 2388.3  -4776.7                         \nmodel7    7 -4956.5 -4918.9 2485.2  -4970.5 193.76  1  &lt; 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1",

    "section": "\n9.5 Global Regression",
    "text": "9.5 Global Regression\nTo provide an intuitive understanding of GWR, a useful start is to explore the data using an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression model. The key issue here is to understand if high incidence of COVID-19 is linked to structural differences across UTLAs in England. As indicated above, confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 have been associated with overcrowded housing, vulnerable populations - including people in elderly age groups, economically disadvantaged groups and those suffering from chronic health conditions - ethnic minorities, critical workers in the health & social work, education, accommodation & food, transport, and administrative & support sectors. So, let’s create a set of variables to approximate these factors.\n\n# define predictors\nutla_shp &lt;- utla_shp %&gt;% mutate(\n  crowded_hou = Crwd_ / Hshld, # share of crowded housing\n  elderly = (A_65_ + Ag_85) / Rsdnt, # share of population aged 65+\n  lt_illness = Lng__ / Rsdnt, # share of population in long-term illness\n  ethnic = (Mixed + Indin + Pkstn + Bngld + Chins + Oth_A + Black + Othr_t) / Rsdnt, # share of nonwhite population\n  imd19_ext = IMD20, # proportion of a larger area’s population living in the most deprived LSOAs in the country\n  hlthsoc_sec = H____ / E_16_, # share of workforce in the human health & social work sector\n  educ_sec = Edctn / E_16_, # share of workforce in the education sector\n  trnsp_sec= Trn__ / E_16_, # share of workforce in the Transport & storage sector\n  accfood_sec = Ac___ / E_16_, # share of workforce in the accommodation & food service sector\n  admsupport_sec = Adm__ /  E_16_, # share of workforce in the administrative & support sector\n  pblic_sec = Pb___ / E_16_ # share of workforce in the public administration & defence sector\n)\n\nLet’s quickly examine how they correlate to our outcome variable i.e. incidence rate of COVID-19 using correlation coefficients and correlograms.\n\n# obtain a matrix of Pearson correlation coefficients\ndf_sel &lt;- st_set_geometry(utla_shp[,37:48], NULL) # temporary data set removing geometries\ncormat &lt;- cor(df_sel, use=\"complete.obs\", method=\"pearson\")\n\n# significance test\nsig1 &lt;- corrplot::cor.mtest(df_sel, conf.level = .95)\n\n# creta a correlogram\ncorrplot::corrplot(cormat, type=\"lower\",\n                   method = \"circle\", \n                   order = \"original\", \n                   tl.cex = 0.7,\n                   p.mat = sig1$p, sig.level = .05, \n                   col = viridis::viridis(100, option = \"plasma\"),\n                   diag = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correlogram shows the strength and significance of the linear relationship between our set of variables. The size of the circle reflects the strength of the relationships as captured by the Pearson correlation coefficient, and crosses indicate statistically insignificant relationships at the 95% level of confidence. The colour indicate the direction of the relationship with dark (light) colours indicating a negative (positive) association.\nThe results indicate that the incidence of COVID-19 is significantly and positively related to the share of overcrowded housing, nonwhite ethnic minorities and administrative & support workers. Against expectations, the incidence of COVID-19 appears to be negatively correlated with the share of elderly population, of population suffering from long-term illness and of administrative & support workers, and displays no significant association with the share of the population living in deprived areas as well as the share of public administration & defence workers, and health & social workers. The latter probably reflects the effectiveness of the protective measures undertaken to prevent infection among these population groups, but it may also reflect the partial coverage of COVID-19 testing and underreporting. It may also reveal the descriptive limitations of correlation coefficients as they show the relationship between a pairs of variables, not controlling for others. Correlation coefficients can thus produce spurious relationships resulting from confounded variables. We will return to this point below.\nThe results also reveal high collinearity between particular pairs of variables, notably between the share of crowded housing and of nonwhite ethnic population, the share of crowded housing and of elderly population, the share of overcrowded housing and of administrative & support workers, the share of elderly population and of population suffering from long-term illness. A more refined analysis of multicollinearity is needed. Various diagnostics for multicollinearity in a regression framework exist, including matrix condition numbers (CNs), predictor variance inflation factors (VIFs) and variance decomposition factors (VDPs). Rules of thumb (CNs &gt; 30, VIFs &gt; 10 and VDPs &gt; 0.5) to indicate worrying levels of collinearity can be found in Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch (2005). To avoid problems of multicollinearity, often a simple strategy is to remove highly correlated predictors. The difficultly is in deciding which predictor(s) to remove, especially when all are considered important. Keep this in mind when specifying your model.\n\nChallenge 2: Analyse the relationship of all the variables executing pairs(df_sel). How accurate would a linear regression be in capturing the relationships for our set of variables?\n\n\n9.5.1 Global Regression Results\nTo gain a better understanding of these relationships, we can regress the incidence rate of COVID-19 on a series of factors capturing differences across areas. To focus on the description of GWR, we keep our analysis simple and study the incidence rate of COVID-19 as a function of the share of nonwhite ethnic population and of population suffering from long-term illness by estimating the following OLS linear regression model:\n\n# attach data\nattach(utla_shp)\n\n# specify a model equation\neq1 &lt;- covid19_r ~ ethnic + lt_illness\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(formula = eq1, data = utla_shp)\n\n# estimates\nsummary(model1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = eq1, data = utla_shp)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-109.234  -38.386   -4.879   29.284  143.786 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

A one percentage point increase in the share of nonwhite population returns a 271 rise in the cumulative count of COVID-19 infection per 100,000 people, everything else constant. The results also reveal a positive (albeit statistically insignificant) relationship between the share of population suffering from long-term illness and an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, after controlling for the share of nonwhite population, thereby confirming our suspicion about the limitations of correlation coefficients; that is, once differences in the share of nonwhite population are taken into account, the association between the share of population suffering from long-term illness and an increased risk of COVID-19 infection becomes positive. We also test for multicollinearity. The VIFs are below 10 indicating that multicollinearity is not highly problematic.\nThe \\(R^{2}\\) value for the OLS regression is 0.393 indicating that our model explains only 39% of the variance in the rate of COVID-19 infection. This leaves 71% of the variance unexplained. Some of this unexplained variance can be because we have only included two explanatory variables in our model, but also because the OLS regression model assumes that the relationships in the model are constant over space; that is, it assumes a stationary process. Hence, an OLS regression model is considered to capture global relationships. However, relationships may vary over space. Suppose, for instance, that there are intrinsic behavioural variations across England and that people have adhered more strictly to self-isolation and social distancing measures in some areas than in others, or that ethnic minorities are less exposed to contracting COVID-19 in certain parts of England. If such variations in associations exist over space, our estimated OLS model will be a misspecification of reality because it assumes these relationships to be constant.\nTo better understand this potential misspecification, we investigate the model residuals which show high variability (see below). The distribution is non-random displaying large positive residuals in the metropolitan areas of London, Liverpool, Newcastle (in light colours) and the Lake District and large negative residuals across much of England (in black). This conforms to the spatial pattern of confirmed COVID-19 cases with high concentration in a limited number of metropolitan areas (see above). While our residual map reveals that there is a problem with the OLS model, it does not indicate which, if any, of the parameters in the model might exhibit spatial nonstationarity. A simple way of examining if the relationships being modelled in our global OLS model are likely to be stationary over space would be to estimate separate OLS model for each UTLA in England. But this would require higher resolution i.e. data within UTLA, and we only have one data point per UTLA. -Fotheringham, Brunsdon, and Charlton (2002) (2002, p.40-44) discuss alternative approaches and their limitations.\n\nutla_shp$res_m1 &lt;- residuals(model1)\n\n# map\nlegend_title = expression(\"OLS residuals\")\nmap_utla = tm_shape(utla_shp) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"res_m1\", title = legend_title, palette = magma(256), style = \"cont\") + # add fill\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .1)  + # add borders\n  tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\") , size = 5) + # add compass\n  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0,1,2), text.size = 0.7, position =  c(\"center\", \"bottom\")) + # add scale bar\n  tm_layout(bg.color = \"white\") # change background colour\nmap_utla + tm_shape(reg_shp) + # add region boundaries\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .5) # add borders",

    "text": "9.6 Fitting a Geographically Weighted Regression\nGWR overcomes the limitation of the OLS regression model of generating a global set of estimates. The basic idea behind GWR is to examine the way in which the relationships between a dependent variable and a set of predictors might vary over space. GWR operates by moving a search window from one regression point to the next, working sequentially through all the existing regression points in the dataset. A set of regions is then defined around each regression point and within the search window. A regression model is then fitted to all data contained in each of the identified regions around a regression point, with data points closer to the sample point being weighted more heavily than are those farther away. This process is repeated for all samples points in the dataset. For a data set of 150 observations GWR will fit 150 weighted regression models. The resulting local estimates can then be mapped at the locations of the regression points to view possible variations in the relationships between variables.\nGraphically, GWR involves fitting a spatial kernel to the data as described in the Fig. 1. For a given regression point \\(X\\), the weight (\\(W\\)) of a data point is at a maximum at the location of the regression point. The weight decreases gradually as the distance between two points increases. A regression model is thus calibrated locally by moving the regression point across the area under study. For each location, the data are weighted differently so that the resulting estimates are unique to a particular location.\n\n\nFig. 1. GWR with fixed spatial kernel. Source: Fotheringham et al. (2002, 45).\n\n\n9.6.1 Fixed or Adaptive Kernel\nA key issue is to decide between two options of spatial kernels: a fixed kernel or an adaptive kernel. Intuitively, a fixed kernel involves using a fixed bandwidth to define a region around all regression points as displayed in Fig. 1. The extent of the kernel is determined by the distance to a given regression point, with the kernel being identical at any point in space. An adaptive kernel involves using varying bandwidth to define a region around regression points as displayed in Fig. 2. The extent of the kernel is determined by the number of nearest neighbours from a given regression point. The kernels have larger bandwidths where the data are sparse.\n\n\nFig. 2. GWR with adaptive spatial kernel. Source: Fotheringham et al. (2002, 47).\n\n\n9.6.2 Optimal Bandwidth\nA second issue is to define the extent of geographical area (i.e. optimal bandwidth) of the spatial kernel. The bandwidth is the distance beyond which a value of zero is assigned to weight observations. Larger bandwidths include a larger number of observations receiving a non-zero weight and more observations are used to fit a local regression.\nTo determine the optimal bandwidth, a cross-validation approach is applied; that is, for a location, a local regression is fitted based on a given bandwidth and used to predict the value of the dependent variable. The resulting predicted value is used to compute the residuals of the model. Residuals are compared using a series of bandwidth and the bandwidth returning the smallest local residuals are selected.\nVariance and Bias Trade off\nChoosing an optimal bandwidth involves a compromise between bias and precision. For example, a larger bandwidth will involve using a larger number of observations to fit a local regression, and hence result in reduced variance (or increased precision) but high bias of estimates. On the other hand, too small bandwidth involves using a very small number of observations resulting in increased variance but small bias. An optimal bandwidth offers a compromise between bias and variance.\n\n9.6.3 Shape of Spatial Kernel\nTwo general set of kernel functions can be distinguished: continuous kernels and kernels with compact support. Continuous kernels are used to weight all observations in the study area and includes uniform, Gaussian and Exponential kernel functions. Kernel with compact support are used to assign a nonzero weight to observations within a certain distance and a zero weight beyond it. The shape of the kernel has been reported to cause small changes to resulting estimates (Brunsdon, Fotheringham, and Charlton 1998).\n\n9.6.4 Selecting a Bandwidth\nLet’s now implement a GWR model. The first key step is to define the optimal bandwidth. We first illustrate the use of a fixed spatial kernel.\n\n9.6.4.1 Fixed Bandwidth\nCross-validation is used to search for the optimal bandwidth. Recall that this procedure compares the model residuals based on different bandwidths and chooses the optimal solution i.e. the bandwidth returning the smallest model residuals based on a given model specification. A key parameter here is the shape of the geographical weight function (gweight). We set it to be a Gaussian function which is the default. A bi-square function is recommended to reduce computational time. Since we have a simple model, a Gaussian function should not take that long. Note that we set the argument longlat to TRUE and use latitude and longitude for coordinates (coords). When longlat is set to TRUE, distances are measured in kilometres.\n\n# find optimal kernel bandwidth using cross validation\nfbw &lt;- gwr.sel(eq1, \n               data = utla_shp, \n               coords=cbind( long, lat),\n               longlat = TRUE,\n               adapt=FALSE, \n               gweight = gwr.Gauss, \n               verbose = FALSE)\n\n# view selected bandwidth\nfbw\n\n[1] 29.30417\n\n\nThe result indicates that the optimal bandwidth is 39.79 kms. This means that neighbouring UTLAs within a fixed radius of 39.79 kms will be taken to estimate local regressions. To estimate a GWR, we execute the code below in which the optimal bandwidth above is used as an input in the argument bandwidth.\n\n# fit a gwr based on fixed bandwidth\nfb_gwr &lt;- gwr(eq1, \n            data = utla_shp,\n            coords=cbind( long, lat),\n            longlat = TRUE,\n            bandwidth = fbw, \n            gweight = gwr.Gauss,\n            hatmatrix=TRUE, \n            se.fit=TRUE)\n\nfb_gwr\n\nCall:\ngwr(formula = eq1, data = utla_shp, coords = cbind(long, lat), \n    bandwidth = fbw, gweight = gwr.Gauss, hatmatrix = TRUE, longlat = TRUE, \n    se.fit = TRUE)\nKernel function: gwr.Gauss \nFixed bandwidth: 29.30417 \nSummary of GWR coefficient estimates at data points:\n                  Min.   1st Qu.

Now, we want to focus on the overall model fit and will map the results of the \\(R^{2}\\) for the estimated local regressions. To do this, we extract the model results stored in a Spatial Data Frame (SDF) and add them to our spatial data frame utla_shp. Note that the Quasi-global \\(R^{2}\\) is very high (0.77) indicating a high in-sample prediction accuracy.\n\n# write gwr output into a data frame\nfb_gwr_out &lt;- as.data.frame(fb_gwr$SDF)\n\nutla_shp$fmb_localR2 &lt;- fb_gwr_out$localR2\n\n# map\n  # Local R2\nlegend_title = expression(\"Fixed: Local R2\")\nmap_fbgwr1 = tm_shape(utla_shp) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"fmb_localR2\", title = legend_title, palette = magma(256), style = \"cont\") + # add fill\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .1)  + # add borders\n  tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\") , size = 5) + # add compass\n  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0,1,2), text.size = 0.7, position =  c(\"center\", \"bottom\")) + # add scale bar\n  tm_layout(bg.color = \"white\") # change background colour\nmap_fbgwr1 + tm_shape(reg_shp) + # add region boundaries\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .5) # add borders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map shows very high in-sample model predictions of up to 80% in relatively large UTLAs (i.e. Cornwall, Devon and Cumbria) but poor predictions in Linconshire and small UTLAs in the North West and Yorkshire & The Humber Regions and the Greater London. The spatial distribution of this pattern may reflect a potential problem that arise in the application of GWR with fixed spatial kernels. The use of fixed kernels implies that local regressions for small spatial units may be calibrated on a large number of dissimilar areas, while local regressions for large areas may be calibrated on very few data points, giving rise to estimates with large standard errors. In extreme cases, generating estimates might not be possible due to insufficient variation in small samples. In practice, this issue is relatively common if the number of geographical areas in the dataset is small.\n\n9.6.4.2 Adaptive Bandwidth\nTo reduce these problems, adaptive spatial kernels can be used. These kernels adapt in size to variations in the density of the data so that the kernels have larger bandwidths where the data are sparse and have smaller bandwidths where the data are plentiful. As above, we first need to search for the optimal bandwidth before estimating a GWR.\n\n# find optimal kernel bandwidth using cross validation\nabw &lt;- gwr.sel(eq1, \n               data = utla_shp, \n               coords=cbind( long, lat),\n               longlat = TRUE,\n               adapt = TRUE, \n               gweight = gwr.Gauss, \n               verbose = FALSE)\n\n# view selected bandwidth\nabw\n\n[1] 0.03126972\n\n\nThe optimal bandwidth is 0.03 indicating the proportion of observations (or k-nearest neighbours) to be included in the weighting scheme. In this example, the optimal bandwidth indicates that for a given UTLA, 3% of its nearest neighbours should be used to calibrate the relevant local regression; that is about 5 UTLAs. The search window will thus be variable in size depending on the extent of UTLAs. Note that here the optimal bandwidth is defined based on a data point’s k-nearest neighbours. It can also be defined by geographical distance as done above for the fixed spatial kernel.

Estimates are still poor in hot spot UTLAs concentrating confirmed cases of COVID-19, such as the Greater London, Liverpool and Newcastle areas.\n\n9.6.6 Interpretation\nThe key strength of GWR models is in identifying patterns of spatial variation in the associations between pairs of variables. The results reveal how these coefficients vary across the 150 UTLAs of England. To examine this variability, let’s first focus on the adaptive GWR output reported in Section 8.6.4.2. The output includes a summary of GWR coefficient estimates at various data points. The last column reports the global estimates which are the same as the coefficients from the OLS regression we fitted at the start of our analysis. For our variable nonwhite ethnic population, the GWR outputs reveals that local coefficients range from a minimum value of -148.41 to a maximum value of 1076.84, indicating that one percentage point increase in the share of nonwhite ethnic population is associated with a a reduction of 148.41 in the number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 people in some UTLAs and an increase of 1076.84 in others. For half of the UTLAs in the dataset, as the share of nonwhite ethnic population increases by one percentage point, the rate of COVID-19 will increase between 106.29 and 291.24 cases; that is, the inter-quartile range between the 1st Qu and the 3rd Qu. To analyse the spatial structure, we next map the estimated coefficients obtained from the adaptive kernel GWR.\n\n  # Ethnic\nlegend_title = expression(\"Ethnic\")\nmap_abgwr2 = tm_shape(utla_shp) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"amb_ethnic\", title = legend_title, palette = magma(256), style = \"cont\") + # add fill\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .1)  + # add borders\n  tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\") , size = 5) + # add compass\n  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0,1,2), text.size = 0.7, position =  c(\"center\", \"bottom\")) + # add scale bar\n  tm_layout(bg.color = \"white\") # change background colour\nmap_abgwr2 = map_abgwr2 + tm_shape(reg_shp) + # add region boundaries\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .5) # add borders\n\n  # Long-term Illness\nlegend_title = expression(\"Long-term illness\")\nmap_abgwr3 = tm_shape(utla_shp) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"amb_lt_illness\", title = legend_title, palette = magma(256), style = \"cont\") + # add fill\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .1)  + # add borders\n  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0,1,2), text.size = 0.7, position =  c(\"center\", \"bottom\")) + # add scale bar\n  tm_layout(bg.color = \"white\") # change background colour\nmap_abgwr3 = map_abgwr3 + tm_shape(reg_shp) + # add region boundaries\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .5) # add borders\n\ntmap_arrange(map_abgwr2, map_abgwr3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysing the map for long-term illness, a clear North-South divide can be identified. In the North we observed the expected positive relationship between COVID-19 and long-term illness i.e. as the share of the local population suffering from long-term illness rises, the cumulative number of positive COVID-19 cases is expected to increase. In the South, we observe the inverse pattern i.e. as the share of local population suffering from long-term illness rises, the cumulative number of positive COVID-19 cases is expected to drop. This pattern is counterintuitive but may be explained by the wider socio-economic disadvantages between the North and the South of England. The North is usually characterised by a persistent concentration of more disadvantaged neighbourhoods than the South where affluent households have tended to cluster for the last 40 years (Patias, Rowe, and Arribas-Bel 2021).\n\n9.6.7 Assessing statistical significance\nWhile the maps above offer valuable insights to understand the spatial pattering of relationships, they do not identify whether these associations are statistically significant. They may not be. Roughly, if a coefficient estimate has an absolute value of t greater than 1.96 and the sample is sufficiently large, then it is statistically significant. Our sample has only 150 observations, so we are more conservative and considered a coefficient to be statistically significant if it has an absolute value of t larger than 2. Note also that p-values could be computed - see Lu et al. (2014).\n\n# compute t statistic\nutla_shp$t_ethnic = ab_gwr_out$ethnic / ab_gwr_out$ethnic_se\n\n# categorise t values\nutla_shp$t_ethnic_cat &lt;- cut(utla_shp$t_ethnic,\n                     breaks=c(min(utla_shp$t_ethnic), -2, 2, max(utla_shp$t_ethnic)),\n                     labels=c(\"sig\",\"nonsig\", \"sig\"))\n\n# map statistically significant coefs for ethnic\nlegend_title = expression(\"Ethnic: significant\")\nmap_sig = tm_shape(utla_shp) + \n  tm_fill(col = \"t_ethnic_cat\", title = legend_title, legend.hist = TRUE, midpoint = NA, textNA = \"\", colorNA = \"white\") +  # add fill\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .1)  + # add borders\n  tm_compass(type = \"arrow\", position = c(\"right\", \"top\") , size = 5) + # add compass\n  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0,1,2), text.size = 0.7, position =  c(\"center\", \"bottom\")) + # add scale bar\n  tm_layout(bg.color = \"white\", legend.outside = TRUE) # change background colour & place legend outside\n\nmap_sig + tm_shape(reg_shp) + # add region boundaries\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .5) # add borders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# utla count\ntable(utla_shp$t_ethnic_cat)\n\n\n   sig nonsig \n   105     45 \n\n\nFor the share of nonwhite population, 67% of all local coefficients are statistically significant and these are largely in the South of England. Coefficients in the North tend to be insignificant. Through outliers exist in both regions. In the South, nonsignificant coefficients are observed in the metropolitan areas of London, Birmingham and Nottingham, while significant coefficients exist in the areas of Newcastle and Middlesbrough in the North.\n\nChallenge 3 Compute the t values for the intercept and estimated coefficient for long-term illness and create maps of their statistical significance. How many UTLAs report statistically significant coefficients?\n\n\n9.6.8 Collinearity in GWR\nAn important final note is: collinearity tends to be problematic in GWR models. It can be present in the data subsets to estimate local coefficients even when not observed globally Wheeler and Tiefelsdorf (2005). Collinearity can be highly problematic in the case of compositional, categorical and ordinal predictors, and may result in exact local collinearity making the search for an optimal bandwidth impossible. A recent paper suggests potential ways forward (Comber et al. 2022).",

    "text": "10.3 Why Spatio-Temporal Analysis?\nInvestigating the spatial patterns of human processes as we have done so far in this book only offers a partial incomplete representation of these processes. It does not allow understanding of the temporal evolution of these processes. Human processes evolve in space and time. Human mobility is a inherent geographical process which changes over the course of the day, with peaks at rush hours and high concentration towards employment, education and retail centres. Exposure to air pollution changes with local climatic conditions, and emission and concentration of atmospheric pollutants which fluctuate over time. The rate of disease spread varies over space and may significantly change over time as we have seen during the current outbreak, with flattened or rapid declining trends in Australia, New Zealand and South Korea but fast proliferation in the United Kingdom and the United States. Only by considering time and space together we can address how geographic entities change over time and why they change. A large part of how and why of such change occurs is due to interactions across space and time, and multiple processes. It is essential to understand the past to inform our understanding of the present and make predictions about the future.\n\n10.3.1 Spatio-temporal Data Structures\nA first key element is to understand the structure of spatio-temporal data. Spatio-temporal data incorporate two dimensions. At one end, we have the temporal dimension. In quantitative analysis, time-series data are used to capture geographical processes at regular or irregular intervals; that is, in a continuous (daily) or discrete (only when a event occurs) temporal scale. At another end, we have the spatial dimension. We often use spatial data as temporal aggregations or temporally frozen states (or ‘snapshots’) of a geographical process - this is what we have done so far. Recall that spatial data can be capture in different geographical units, such as areal or lattice, points, flows or trajectories - refer to the introductory lecture in Week 1. Relatively few ways exist to formally integrate temporal and spatial data in consistent analytical framework. Two notable exceptions in R are the packages TraMiner (Gabadinho et al. 2009) and spacetime (Pebesma et al. 2012). We use the class definitions defined in the R package spacetime. These classes extend those used for spatial data in sp and time-series data in xts. Next a brief introduction to concepts that facilitate thinking about spatio-temporal data structures.\n\n10.3.1.1 Type of Table\nSpatio-temporal data can be conceptualised as three main different types of tables:\n\ntime-wide: a table in which columns correspond to different time points\nspace-wide: a table in which columns correspond to different spatial location\nlong formats: a table in which each row-column pair corresponds to a specific time and spatial location (or space coordinate)\n\n\nNote that data in long format are space inefficient because spatial coordinates and time attributes are required for each data point. Yet, data in this format are relatively easy to manipulate via packages such as dplyr and tidyr, and visualise using ggplot2. These packages are designed to work with data in long format.\n\n\n10.3.1.2 Type of Spatio-Temporal Object\nTo integrate spatio-temporal data, spatio-temporal objects are needed. We consider four different spatio-temporal frames (STFs) or objects which can be defined via the package spacetime:\n\nFull grid (STF): an object containing data on all possible locations in all time points in a sequence of data;\nSparse grid (STS): an object similar to STF but only containing non-missing space-time data combinations;\nIrregular (STI): an object with an irregular space-time data structure, where each point is allocated a spatial coordinate and a time stamp;\nSimple Trajectories (STT): an object containig a sequence of space-time points that form trajectories.\n\nMore details on these spatio-temporal structures, construction and manipulation, see Pebesma et al. (2012). Enough theory, let’s code!",

    "section": "\n10.4 Data Wrangling",
    "text": "10.4 Data Wrangling\nThis section illustrates the complexities of handling spatio-temporal data. It discusses good practices in data manipulation and construction of a Space Time Irregular Data Frame (STIDF) object. Three key requirements to define a STFDF object are:\n\nHave a data frame in long format i.e. a location-time pair data frame\nDefine a time stamp\nConstruct the spatio-temporal object of class STIDF by indicating the spatial and temporal coordinates\n\nLet’s now read all the required data. While we can have all data in a single data frame, you will find helpful to have separate data objects to identify:\n\nspatial locations\ntemporal units\ndata\n\nThese data objects correspond to locs, time, and covid19 and censusimd below. Throughout the chapter you will notice that we switch between the various data frames when convinient, depending on the operation.\n\n# clear workspace\nrm(list=ls())\n\n# read ONS UTLA shapefile\nutla_shp &lt;- st_read(\"data/sta/ons_utla.shp\") \n\nReading layer `ons_utla' from data source \n  `/Users/franciscorowe/Dropbox/Francisco/uol/teaching/envs453/202324/san/data/sta/ons_utla.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 150 features and 11 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 134112.4 ymin: 11429.67 xmax: 655653.8 ymax: 657536\nProjected CRS: Transverse_Mercator\n\n# create table of locations\nlocs &lt;- utla_shp %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(objct, cty19c, ctyu19nm, long, lat, st_rs) \n\n# read time data frame\ntime &lt;- read_csv(\"data/sta/reporting_dates.csv\")\n\n# read COVID-19 data in long format\ncovid19 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/sta/covid19_cases.csv\")\n\n# read census and IMD data\ncensusimd &lt;- read_csv(\"data/sta/2011census_2019imd_utla.csv\")\n\nIf we explore the structure of the data via head and str, we can see we have data on daily and cumulative new COVID-19 cases for 150 spatial units (i.e. UTLAs) over 71 time points from January 30th to April 21st. We also have census and IMD data for a range of attributes.\n\nhead(covid19, 3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 6\n  Area.name            Area.code Area.type     date       Daily.lab.confirmed.…¹\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;date&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Barking and Dagenham E09000002 Upper tier l… 2020-01-30                      0\n2 Barnet               E09000003 Upper tier l… 2020-01-30                      0\n3 Barnsley             E08000016 Upper tier l… 2020-01-30                      0\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​Daily.lab.confirmed.cases\n# ℹ 1 more variable: Cumulative.lab.confirmed.cases &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nOnce we have understood the structure of the data, we first need to confirm if the covid19 data are in wide or long format. Luckily they are in long format; otherwise, we would have needed to transform the data from wide to long format. Useful functions to achieve this include pivot_longer (pivot_longer) which has superseded gather (spread) in the tidyr package. Note that the covid19 data frame has 10,650 observations (i.e. rows); that is, 150 UTLAs * 71 daily observations.\nWe then define a regular time stamp for our temporal data. We use the lubridate package to do this. A key advantage of lubridate is that it automatically recognises the common separators used when recording dates (“-”, “/”, “.”, and ““). As a result, you only need to focus on specifying the order of the date elements to determine the parsing function applied. Below we check the structure of our time data, define a time stamp and create separate variables for days, weeks, months and year.\n\nNote that working with dates can be a complex task.

    "text": "10.5 Exploring Spatio-Temporal Data\nWe now have all the required data in place. In this section various methods of data visualisation are illustrated before key dimensions of the data are explored. Both of these types of exploration can be challenging as one or more dimensions in space and one in time need to be interrogated.\n\n10.5.1 Visualisation\nIn the context spatio-temporal data, a first challenge is data visualization. Visualising more than two dimensions of spatio-temporal data, so it is helpful to slice or aggregate the data over a dimension, use color, or build animations through time. Before exploring the data, we need to define our key variable of interest; that is, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people. We also compute the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people as it may be handy in some analyses.\nFisrt create variable to be analysed:\n\n# rate of new covid-19 infection\ncovid19_spt$n_covid19_r &lt;- round( (covid19_spt$Daily.lab.confirmed.cases / covid19_spt$Residents) * 100000)\ncovid19$n_covid19_r &lt;- round( (covid19$Daily.lab.confirmed.cases / covid19$Residents) * 100000 )\n\n# risk of cumulative covid-19 infection\ncovid19_spt$c_covid19_r &lt;- round( (covid19_spt$Cumulative.lab.confirmed.cases / covid19_spt$Residents) * 100000)\ncovid19$c_covid19_r &lt;- round( (covid19$Cumulative.lab.confirmed.cases / covid19$Residents) * 100000)\n\n\n10.5.1.1 Spatial Plots\nOne way to visualise the data is using spatial plots; that is, snapshots of a geographic process for a given time period. Data can be mapped in different ways using clorepleth, countour or surface plots. The key aim of these maps is to understand how the overall extent of spatial variation and local patterns of spatial concentration change over time. Below we visualise the weekly number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people.\n\nNote that Weeks range from 5 to 16 as they refer to calendar weeks. Calendar week 5 is when the first COVID-19 case in England was reported.\n\n\n# create data frame for new cases by week\ndaycases_week &lt;- covid19_spt %&gt;% \n  group_by(week, ctyu19nm, \n           as.character(cty19c), \n           Residents) %&gt;%\n  summarise(n_daycases = sum(Daily.lab.confirmed.cases)) \n\n# weekly rate of new covid-19 infection\ndaycases_week$wn_covid19_r &lt;- (daycases_week$n_daycases / daycases_week$Residents) * 100000\n\n# map\nlegend_title = expression(\"Cumulative Cases per 100,000 Population\")\ntm_shape(daycases_week) +\n  tm_fill(\"wn_covid19_r\", title = legend_title, palette = magma(256), style =\"cont\", legend.hist=FALSE, legend.is.portrait=FALSE) +\n  tm_facets(by = \"week\", ncol = 4) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\", lwd = .1)  + # add borders +\n  tm_layout(bg.color = \"white\", # change background colour\n            legend.outside = TRUE, # legend outside\n            legend.outside.position = \"bottom\",\n            legend.stack = \"horizontal\",\n            legend.title.size = 2,\n            legend.width = 1,\n            legend.height = 1,\n            panel.label.size = 3,\n            main.title = \"New COVID-19 Cases by Calendar Week, UTLA, England\") \n\nWarning in pre_process_gt(x, interactive = interactive, orig_crs =\ngm$shape.orig_crs): legend.width controls the width of the legend within a map.\nPlease use legend.outside.size to control the width of the outside legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe series of maps reveal a stable pattern of low reported cases from calendar weeks 5 to 11. From week 12 a number of hot spots emerged, notably in London, Birmingham, Cumbria and subsequently around Liverpool. The intensity of new cases seem to have started to decline from week 15; yet, it is important to note that week 16 display reported cases for only two days.\n\n10.5.1.2 Time-Series Plots\nTime-series plots can be used to capture a different dimension of the process in analysis. They can be used to better understand changes in an observation location, an aggregation of observations, or multiple locations simultaneously over time. We plot the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people for UTLAs reporting over 310 cases. The plots identify the UTLAs in London, Newcastle and Sheffield reporting the largest numbers of COVID-19 cases. The plots also reveal that there has been a steady increase in the number of cases, with some differences. While cases have steadily increase in Brent and Southwark since mid March, the rise has been more sudden in Sunderland. The plots also reveal a possible case of misreporting in Sutton towards the end of the series.\n\ntsp &lt;- ggplot(data = covid19_spt,\n            mapping = aes(x = date, y = c_covid19_r,\n                          group = ctyu19nm))\ntsp + geom_line(color = \"blue\") + \n    gghighlight(max(c_covid19_r) &gt; 310, use_direct_label = FALSE) +\n    labs(title= paste(\" \"), x=\"Date\", y=\"Cumulative Cases per 100,000\") +\n    theme_classic() +\n    theme(plot.title=element_text(size = 20)) +\n    theme(axis.text=element_text(size=16)) +\n    theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 18)) +\n    theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 18)) +\n    theme(plot.subtitle=element_text(size = 16)) +\n    theme(axis.title=element_text(size=20, face=\"plain\")) +\n    facet_wrap(~ ctyu19nm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.5.1.3 Hovmöller Plots\nAn alternative visualisation is a Hovmöller plot - sometimes known as heatmap. It is a two-dimensional space-time representation in which space is collapsed onto one dimension against time. Hovmöller plots can easily be generated if the data are arranged on a space-time grid; however, this is rarely the case. Luckily we have ggplot! which can do magic rearranging the data as needed. Below we produce a Hovmöller plot for UTLAs with resident populations over 260,000. The plot makes clear that the critical period of COVID-19 spread has been during April despite the implementation of a series of social distancing measures by the government.\n\nggplot(data = dplyr::filter(covid19_spt, Residents &gt; 260000), \n           mapping = aes(x= date, y= reorder(ctyu19nm, c_covid19_r), fill= c_covid19_r)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_viridis(name=\"New Cases per 100,000\", option =\"plasma\", begin = 0, end = 1, direction = 1) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(title= paste(\" \"), x=\"Date\", y=\"Upper Tier Authority Area\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  theme(legend.title = element_text(size=15)) +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=10)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=15)) +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=20, face=\"plain\")) +\n  theme(legend.key.width = unit(5, \"cm\"), legend.key.height = unit(2, \"cm\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.5.1.4 Interactive Plots\nInteractive visualisations comprise very effective ways to understand spatio-temporal data and they are now fairly accessible. Interactive visualisations allow for a more data-immersive experience, and enable exploration of the data without having to resort to scripting. Here is when the use of tmap shines as it does not only enables easily creating nice static maps but also interactive maps! Below an interactive map for a time snapshot of the data (i.e. 2020-04-14) is produced, but with a bit of work layers can be added to display multiple temporal slices of the data.\n\n# map\nlegend_title = expression(\"Cumulative Cases per 100,000 Population\")\nimap = tm_shape(dplyr::filter(covid19_spt[,c(\"ctyu19nm\", \"date\", \"c_covid19_r\")], as.character(date) == \"2020-04-14\"), labels = \"Area.name\") +\n  tm_fill(\"c_covid19_r\", title = legend_title, palette = magma(256), style =\"cont\", legend.is.portrait=FALSE, alpha = 0.7) +\n  tm_borders(col = \"white\") +\n  #tm_text(\"ctyu19nm\", size = .4) +\n  tm_layout(bg.color = \"white\", # change background colour\n            legend.outside = TRUE, # legend outside\n            legend.title.size = 1,\n            legend.width = 1) \n\nTo view the map on your local machines, execute the code chunk below removing the # sign.\n\n#tmap_mode(\"view\")\n#imap\n\nAlternative data visualisation tools are animations, telliscope and shiny. Animations can be constructed by plotting spatial data frame-by-frame, and then stringing them together in sequence. A useful R packages gganimate and tmap! See Lovelace, Nowosad, and Muenchow (2019). Note that the creation of animations may require external dependencies; hence, they have been included here. Both telliscope and shiny are useful ways for visualising large spatio-temporal data sets in an interactive ways. Some effort is required to deploy these tools.\n\n10.5.2 Exploratory Analysis\nIn addition to visualising data, we often want to obtain numerical summaries of the data. Again, innovative ways to reduce the inherent dimensionality of the data and examine dependence structures and potential relationships in time and space are needed. We consider visualisations of empirical spatial and temporal means, dependence structures and some basic time-series analysis.\n\n10.5.2.1 Means\nEmpirical Spatial Mean\nThe empirical spatial mean for a data set can be obtained by averaging over time points for one location. In our case, we can compute the empirical spatial mean by averaging the daily rate of new COVID-19 cases for UTLAs between January 30th and April 21st. It reveals that Brent, Southwark and Sunderland report an average daily infection rate of over 5 new cases per 100,000 people, whereas Rutland and Isle of Wight display an average of less than 1.\n\n# compute empirical spatial mean\nsp_av &lt;- covid19_spt %&gt;% group_by(ctyu19nm) %&gt;% # group by spatial unit\n  summarise(sp_mu_emp = mean(n_covid19_r))\n\n# plot empirical spatial mean\nggplot(data=sp_av) +\n  geom_col( aes( y = reorder(ctyu19nm, sp_mu_emp), x = sp_mu_emp) , fill = \"grey50\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(title= paste(\" \"), x=\"Average New Cases per 100,000\", y=\"Upper Tier Authority Area\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=7)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=12)) +\n  theme(axis.title=element_text(size=20, face=\"plain\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical Temporal Mean\nThe empirical temporal mean for a data set can be obtained by averaging across spatial locations for a time point. In our case, we can compute the empirical temporal mean by averaging the rate of new COVID-19 cases over UTLAs by day. The empirical temporal mean is plotted below revealing a peak of 8.32 number of new cases per 100,000 people the 7th of April, steadily decreasing to 0.35 for the last reporting observation in our data; that is, April 21st.\n\nNote the empirical temporal mean is smoothed via local polynomial regression fitting; hence below zero values are reported between February and March.\n\n\n# compute temporal mean\ntm_av &lt;- covid19 %&gt;% group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(tm_mu_emp = mean(n_covid19_r))\n\n# plot temporal mean + trends for all spatial units\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data = covid19, mapping = aes(x =date, y = n_covid19_r,\n                          group = Area.name), color = \"gray80\") +\n   theme_classic() +\n  geom_smooth(data = tm_av, mapping = aes(x =date, y = tm_mu_emp), \n              alpha = 0.5,\n              se = FALSE) +\n    labs(title= paste(\" \"), x=\"Date\", y=\"Cumulative Cases per 100,000\") +\n    theme_classic() +\n    theme(plot.title=element_text(size = 18)) +\n    theme(axis.text=element_text(size=14)) +\n    theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16)) +\n    theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16)) +\n    theme(plot.subtitle=element_text(size = 16)) +\n    theme(axis.title=element_text(size=18, face=\"plain\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.5.2.2 Dependence\nSpatial Dependence\nAs we know spatial dependence refers to the spatial relationship of a variable’s values for a pairs of locations at a certain distance apart, so that are more similar (or less similar) than expected for randomly associated pairs of observations. Patterns of spatial dependence may change over time. In the case of a disease outbreak patterns of spatial dependence can change very quickly as new cases emerge and social distancing measures are implemented. Chapter 6 illustrates how to measure spatial dependence in the context of spatial data.\n\nChallenge 1: Measure how spatial dependence change over time. Hint: compute the Moran’s I on the rate of new COVID-19 cases (i.e. n_covid19_r in the covid19 data frame) at multiple time points.\n\n\nNote: recall that the problem of ignoring the dependence in the errors when doing OLS regression is that the resulting standard errors and prediction standard errors are inappropriate. In the case of positive dependence, which is the most common case in spatio-temporal data (recall Tobler’s law), the standard errors and prediction standard errors are underestimated. This is if dependence is ignored, resulting in a false sense of how good the estimates and predictions really are.\n\nTemporal Dependence\nAs for spatial data, dependence can also exists in temporal data. Temporal dependence or temporal autocorrelation exists when a variable’s value at time \\(t\\) is dependent on its value(s) at \\(t-1\\). More recent observations are often expected to have a greater influence on present observations. A key difference between temporal and spatial dependence is that temporal dependence is unidirectional (i.e. past observations can only affect present or future observations but not inversely), while spatial dependence is multidirectional (i.e. an observation in a spatial unit can influence and be influenced by observations in multiple spatial units).\nBefore measuring the temporal dependence is our time-series, a time-series object needs to be created with a time stamp and given cycle frequency. A cycle frequency refers to when a seasonal pattern is repeated. We consider a time series of the total number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 (i.e. we sum cases over UTLAs by day) and the frequency set to 7 to reflect weekly cycles. So we end up with a data frame of length 71.\n\n# create a time series object\ntotal_cnt &lt;- covid19 %&gt;% group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(new_cases = sum(n_covid19_r)) \ntotal_cases_ts &lt;- ts(total_cnt$new_cases, \n                     start = 1,\n                     frequency =7)\n\nThere are various ways to test for temporal autocorrelation. An easy way is to compute the correlation coefficient between a time series measured at time \\(t\\) and its lag measured at time \\(t-1\\). Below we measure the temporal autocorrelation in the rate of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people. A correlation of 0.97 is returned indicating high positive autocorrelation; that is, high (low) past numbers of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people tend to correlate with higher (lower) present numbers of new COVID-19 cases. The Durbin-Watson test is often used to test for autocorrelation in regression models.\n\n# create lag term t-1\nlag_new_cases &lt;- total_cnt$new_cases[-1]\ntotal_cnt &lt;- cbind(total_cnt[1:70,], lag_new_cases)\ncor(total_cnt[,2:3])\n\n              new_cases lag_new_cases\nnew_cases      1.000000      0.974284\nlag_new_cases  0.974284      1.000000\n\n\nTime Series Components\nIn addition to temporal autocorrelation, critical to the analysis of time-series are its constituent components. A time-series is generally defined by three key components:\n\nTrend: A trend exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data.\nSeasonal: A seasonal pattern exists when a time series is affected by seasonal factors and is of a fixed and known frequency. Seasonal cycles can occur at various time intervals such as the time of the day or the time of the year.\nCyclic (random): A cycle exists when the data exhibit rises and falls that are not of a fixed frequency.\n\nTo understand and model a time series, these components need to be identified and appropriately incorporated into a regression model. We illustrate these components by decomposing our time series for total COVID-19 cases below. The top plot shows the observed data. Subsequent plots display the trend, seasonal and random components of the total number of COVID-19 cases on a weekly periodicity. They reveal a clear inverted U-shape trend and seasonal pattern. This idea that we can decompose data to extract information and understand temporal processes is key to understand the concept of basis functions to model spatio-temporal data, which will be introduced in the next section.\n\n# decompose time series\ndec_ts &lt;- decompose(total_cases_ts)\n# plot time series components\nplot(dec_ts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a good introduction to time-series analysis in R, refer to Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2018) and DataCamp.",

    "text": "10.6 Spatio-Temporal Data Modelling\nHaving some understanding of the spatio-temporal patterns of COVID-19 spread through data exploration, we are ready to start further examining structural relationships between the rate of new infections and local contextual factors via regression modelling across UTLAs. Specifically we consider the number of new cases per 100,000 people to capture the rate of new infections and only one contextual factor; that is, the share of population suffering from long-term sickness or disabled. We will consider some basic statistical models, of the form of linear regression and generalized linear models, to account for spatio-temporal dependencies in the data. Note that we do not consider more complex structures based on hierarchical models or spatio-temporal weighted regression models which would be the natural step moving forward.\nAs any modelling approach, spatio-temporal statistical modelling has three principal goals:\n\npredicting values of a given outcome variable at some location in space within the time span of the observations and offering information about the uncertainty of those predictions;\nperforming statistical inference about the influence of predictors on an outcome variable in the presence of spatio-temporal dependence; and,\nforecasting future values of an outcome variable at some location, offering information about the uncertainty of the forecast.\n\n\n10.6.1 Intuition\nThe key idea on what follows is to use a basic statistical regression model to understand the relationship between the share of new COVID-19 infections and the share of population suffering from long-term illness, accounting for spatio-temporal dependencies. We will consider what is known as a trend-surface regression model which assumes that spatio-temporal dependencies can be accounted for by “trend” components and incorporate as predictors in the model. Formally we consider the regression model below which seeks to account for spatial and temporal trends.\n\\[y(s_{i}, t_{j}) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{k}x(s_{i}, t_{j}) + e(s_{i}, t_{j})\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_{0}\\) is the intercept and \\(\\beta_{k}\\) represents a set of regression coefficients associated with \\(x(s_{i}, t_{j})\\); the \\(k\\) indicates the number of covariates at spatial location \\(s_{i}\\) and time \\(t_{j}\\); \\(e\\) represents the regression errors which are assumed to follow a normal distribution. The key difference to aproaches considered in previous chapters is the incorporation of space and time together. As we learnt from the previous section, this has implications are we now have two sources of dependence: spatial and temporal autocorrelation, as well as seasonal and trend components. This has implications for modelling as we now need to account for all of these components if we are to establish any relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\).\nA key implication is how we consider the set of covariates represented by \\(x\\). Three key types can be identified:\n\nspatial-variant, temporal-invariant covariates: these are attributes which may vary across space but be temporally invariant, such as geographical distances;\nspatial-invariant, temporal-variant covariates: these are attributes which do not vary across space but change over time; and,\nspatial-variant, temporal-variant covariates: these are attributes which vary over both space and time;\n\n\nNote that what is variant or invariant will depend on the spatial and temporal scale of the analysis.\n\nWe can also consider spatio-temporal “basis functions”. Note that this is an important concept for the rest of the Chapter. What are basis functions then? If you think that spatio-temporal data represent a complex set of curves or surfaces in space, basis functions represent the components into which this set of curves can be decomposed. In this sense, basis functions operate in a similar fashion as the decomposition of time series considered above i.e. time series data can be decomposed into a trend, seasonal and random components and their sum can be used to represent the observed temporal trajectory. Basis functions offer an effective way to incorporate spatio-temporal dependencies. Thus, basis functions have the key goal of accounting for spatio-temporal dependencies as spatial weight matrices or temporal lags help accounting spatial autocorrelation in spatial models and temporal autocorrelation in time series analysis.\nAs standard regression coefficients, basis functions are related to \\(y\\) via coefficients (or weights). The difference is that we typically assume that basis functions are known while coefficients are random. Examples of basis functions include polynomials, splines, wavelets, sines and cosines so various linear combinations that can be used to infer potential spatio-temporal dependencies in the data. This is similar to deep learning models in which cases you provide, for example, an image and the model provides a classification of pixels. But you normally do not know what the classification represents (hence they are known as black boxes!) so further analysis on the classification is needed to understand what the model has attempted to capture. Basically basis functions are smoother functions to represent the observed data, and their objective to capture the spatial and temporal variability in the data as well as their dependence.\nFor our application, we start by considering a basic OLS regression model with the following basis functions to account spatial-temporal structures:\n\noverall mean;\nlinear in lon-coordinate;\nlinear in lat-coordinate;\nlinear time daily trend;\nadditional spatio-temporal basis functions which are presented below; and,\n\nThese basis functions are incorporated as independent variables in the regression model. Additionally, we also include the share of population suffering from long-term illness as we know it is highly correlated to the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases. The share of population suffering long-term illness is incorporated as a spatial-variant, temporal-invariant covariates given that rely in 2011 census data.\n\n10.6.2 Fitting Spatio-Temporal Models\nAs indicated at the start of this Chapter, we use the FRK framework developed by Cressie and Johannesson (2008). It provides a scalable, relies on the use a spatial random effects model (with which we have some familiarity) and can be easily implemented in R by the use of the FRK package (Zammit-Mangion and Cressie 2017). In this framework, a spatially correlated errors can be decomposed using a linear combination of spatial basis functions, effectively addressing issues of spatial-temporal dependence and nonstationarity. The specification of spatio-temporal basis functions is a key component of the model and they can be generated automatically or by the user via the FRK package. We will use the automatically generated functions. While as we will notice they are difficult to interpret, user generated functions require greater understanding of the spatio-temporal structure of COVID-19 which is beyond the scope of this Chapter.\nPrepare Data\nThe first step to create a data frame with the variables that we will consider for the analysis. We first remove the geometries to convert covid19_spt from a simple feature object to a data frame and then compute the share of long-term illness population.\n\n# remove geometries\nst_geometry(covid19_spt) &lt;- NULL\n\n# share of population in long-term illness \ncovid19_spt &lt;- covid19_spt %&gt;% mutate(\n lt_illness = Longterm_sick_or_disabled / Residents\n)\n\nConstruct Basis Functions\nWe now build the set of basis functions. The can be constructed by using the function auto_basis from the FRK package. The function takes as arguments: data, nres (which is the number of “resolutions” or aggregation to construct); and type of basis function to use. We consider a single resolution of the default Gaussian radial basis function.\n\n# build basis functions\nG &lt;- auto_basis(data = covid19_spt[,c(\"long\",\"lat\")] %&gt;%\n                       SpatialPoints(),           # To sp obj\n                nres = 1,                         # One resolution\n                type = \"Gaussian\")                # Gaussian BFs\n# basis functions evaluated at data locations are then the covariates\nS &lt;- eval_basis(basis = G,                       # basis functions\n                s = covid19_spt[,c(\"long\",\"lat\")] %&gt;%\n                     as.matrix()) %&gt;%            # conv. to matrix\n     as.matrix()                                 # conv. to matrix\ncolnames(S) &lt;- paste0(\"B\", 1:ncol(S)) # assign column names\n\nAdd Basis Functions to Data Frame\nWe then prepare a data frame for the regression model, adding the weights extracted from the basis functions. These weights enter as covariates in our model. Note that the resulting number of basis functions is nine. Explore by executing colnames(S). Below we select only relevant variables for our model.\n\n# selecting variables\nreg_df &lt;- cbind(covid19_spt, S) %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(ctyu19nm, n_covid19_r, long, lat, date, lt_illness, B1:B9)\n\nFit Linear Regression\nWe now fit a linear model using lm including as covariates longitude, latitude, day, share of long-term ill population and the nine basis functions.\n\nRecall that latitude refers to north/south from the equator and longitude refers to west/east from Greenwich. Further up north means a higher latitude score. Further west means higher longitude score. Scores for Liverpool (53.4084° N, 2.9916° W) are thus higher than for London (51.5074° N, 0.1278° W). This will be helpful for interpretation.\n\n\neq1 &lt;- n_covid19_r ~ long + lat + date + lt_illness + .\nlm_m &lt;- lm(formula = eq1, \n           data = dplyr::select(reg_df, -ctyu19nm))\nlm_m %&gt;% summary()\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = eq1, data = dplyr::select(reg_df, -ctyu19nm))\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-7.9726 -1.6679 -0.4867  1.1702 22.5346 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

The interpretation of the regression coefficients is as usual; that is, one unit increase in a covariate relates to one unit increase in the dependent variable. For instance, the coefficient for long-term illness population indicates that UTLAs with a larger share of long-term ill population in one percentage point tend to have 328 more new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people! on average. The coefficient for date reveals a strong positive temporal dependence with an average increase in the number of new cases per 100,000 people over time. The coefficient for latitude indicates as we move north the number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people tends to be higher but lower if we move west.\nWhile overall the model provides some understanding of the spatio-temporal structure of the spread of COVID-19, the overall fit of the model is relatively poor. The \\(R^{2}\\) reveals that the model explains only 4.2% of the variability of the spread of COVID-19 cases, reflecting the complexity of modelling spatio-temporal processes. Also, except for two, the coefficients associated to the basis functions are statistically insignificant. A key issue that we have ignored so far is the fact that our dependent variable is a count and is highly skewed - refer back to Section [8.4 Exploratory Analysis].\n\nChallenge 2: Explore a model with only spatial components (i.e. long and lat) or only temporal components (day). What model returns the largest \\(R^{2}\\)?\n\nPoisson Regression\nA Poisson regression model provides a more appropriate framework to address these issues. We do this fitting a general linear model (or GLM) specifying the family function to be a Poisson.\n\n# estimate a poisson model\npoisson_m1 &lt;- glm(eq1,\n                family = poisson(\"log\"), # Poisson + log link\n                data = dplyr::select(reg_df, -ctyu19nm))\npoisson_m1 %&gt;% summary()\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = eq1, family = poisson(\"log\"), data = dplyr::select(reg_df, \n    -ctyu19nm))\n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

Yet, the Poisson model assumes that the mean and variance of the COVID-19 cases is the same. But, given the distribution of our dependent variable, its variance is likely to be greater than the mean. That means the data exhibit “overdispersion”. How do we know this? An estimate of the dispersion is given by the ratio of the deviance to the total degrees of freedom (the number of data points minus the number of covariates). In this case the dispersion estimate is:\n\npoisson_m1$deviance / poisson_m1$df.residual\n\n[1] 2.29953\n\n\nwhich is clearly greater than 1! i.e. the data are overdispersed.\nQuasipoisson Regression\nAn approach to account for overdispersion is to use quasipoisson when calling glm. The quasi-Poisson model assumes that the variance is proportional to the mean, and that the constant of the proportionality is the over-dispersion parameter. This model corrects the standard error of the estimated coefficients. So only p-values and t values are affected. No changes are recorded in terms of residual deviance (24458) and median of deviance residuals (-0.6993), compared to the standard Poisson model.\n\n# estimate a quasipoisson model\nqpoisson_m1 &lt;- glm(eq1,\n                family = quasipoisson(\"log\"), # QuasiPoisson + log link\n                data = dplyr::select(reg_df, -ctyu19nm))\nqpoisson_m1 %&gt;% summary()\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = eq1, family = quasipoisson(\"log\"), data = dplyr::select(reg_df, \n    -ctyu19nm))\n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

The first indicates that as we move one degree north and west, the number of new cases tend to increase in 2 cases. The second indicates that UTLAs located further north of England tend to record a smaller number of cases over time. The third indicates that UTLAs on the west of England tend to report a much higher number of cases as time passes.\nYou can report the output for all models estimated above by executing (after removing #):\n\n# export_summs(lm_m, poisson_m, qpoisson_m1, nb_m1, nb_m2)\n\nNote that you may need to install the huxtable package.\n\n10.6.2.1 Model Comparision\nTo compare regression models based on different specifications and assumptions, like those reported above, you may want to consider the cross-validation approach used in Chapter 5.

For our models, we can achieve this by executing:\n\n# computing predictions for all models\nlm_cnt &lt;- predict(lm_m)\npoisson_cnt &lt;- predict(poisson_m1)\nnb1_cnt &lt;- predict(nb_m1)\nnb2_cnt &lt;- predict(nb_m2)\nreg_df &lt;- cbind(reg_df, lm_cnt, poisson_cnt, nb1_cnt, nb2_cnt)\n\n# computing correlation coefficients\ncormat &lt;- cor(reg_df[, c(\"n_covid19_r\", \"lm_cnt\", \"poisson_cnt\", \"nb1_cnt\", \"nb2_cnt\")], \n              use=\"complete.obs\", \n              method=\"pearson\")\n\n# significance test\nsig1 &lt;- corrplot::cor.mtest(reg_df[, c(\"n_covid19_r\", \"lm_cnt\", \"poisson_cnt\", \"nb1_cnt\", \"nb2_cnt\")],\n                            conf.level = .95)\n\n# create a correlogram\ncorrplot::corrplot.mixed(cormat,\n                         number.cex = 1,\n                         tl.pos = \"d\",\n                         tl.cex = 0.9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the models do a relatively job at predicting the observed count of new COVID-19 cases. They display correlation coefficients of 0.64/5 and high degree of correlation between them. These models will provide a good starting point for the assignment. There are a potentially few easy ways to make some considerable improvement.\n\n\nOption 1 Remove all zeros from the dependent variable n_covid19_r. They are likely to be affecting the ability of the model to predict positive values which are of main interest if we want to understand the spatio-temporal patterns of the outbreak.\n\nOption 2 Remove all zeros from the dependent variable and additionally use its log for the regression model.\n\nOption 3 Include more explanatory variables. Look for factors which can explain the spatial-temporal variability of the current COVID-19 outbreak. Look for hypotheses / anecdotal evidence from the newspapers and social media.\n\nOption 4 Check for collinearity. Collinearity is likely to be an issue given the way basis functions are created. Checking for collinearity of course will not improve the fit of the existing model but it is important to remove collinear terms if statistical inference is a key goal - which in this case is.
