> Flow of the argument: explanation of key components of linear regressions which matter to introduce multilevel models

Relevant assumptions of the linear regression model to recall
* independence of residuals
* constant variability
* mean of residuals = 0 
Not sure if all of this is relevant - not to be written down.


# Multilevel Data Structures

Geographically hierarchical data structure: 
* Stric hierarchy eg. People nested within households, and households nested within neighbourhoods; states nested within countries
* Cross-classified hierarchy eg. People within neighbouhoods and workplaces

Temporally hierarchical data structures eg.
* Repeated measures design or longitudinal data: Individuals followed over time at a particular location


**Why should we care?**

Conceptually, individual observations within a particular grouping can be expected to be more alike than observations from a random set.

* Spatial hetorogeneity

* Spatial dependency

* Contextual dependencies: micro and macro level relationships

Technically, we have incorrect estimates of precision, standard errors, confidence intervals and tests, increased risk of finding relationships and differences where none exists.

## Data

## Long vs wide format

# Single-level Regression Models

$$y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{1i} + e_{i}$$

**Example: estimate regression model**

## Limitations

* Captures averages

* Does not account for spatial and temporal dependencies

* Only captures on macro *vs* micro processes
  +  A macro approach: enables understanding of higher level unit analysis, not individuals within these units > Ecological fallacy
  + A micro approach: enables understanding of individuals without acknoledgement of dependencies between individuals within the same group or spatial unit > Underestimation of standard errors

* May lead to drawn erroneous conclusions frome the identification of misleading relationships

## Adding Group Fixed Effects

Introduce this as adding dummy variables

**Example: estimate regression model**

* The number of groups could be very large, eg households?
* No single parameter assesses between group differences
* Cannot include group-level predictors

# Multilevel Modelling

## The Intuition

Get a more general and simple explanation:
* 2 levels 
* capture the hierarchical structure of the data
* enable capturing for spatial heterogenity, spatial dependence and macro & micro factors in a same model

Micro level or level 1: 
$$y_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + \beta_{1j} x_{1ij} + e_{ij}$$
Macro level or level 2: 
$$\beta_{0j} = \beta_{0} + u_{0j}$$
Embedding level 2 into level 1:
$$y_{ij} = [ \beta_{0} + u_{0j} ] + \beta_{1j} x_{1ij} + e_{ij}$$
where: 
$u_{0j}$ is the level-2 random component and represents variability between groups / areas;
$e_{ij}$ is the level-1 random component and represents variability within groups / areas ie. between level-1 units (eg. houses)

By dividing the variability of the model into different levels, we can estimate the proportion of the variance at each level and assess their extent. This can be achieved by using the variance partitioning coefficient.

Estimating the residuals is more complex! 
For linear regressions $e_{i} = y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i}$
For MLMs, a two step procedure is required:
1. Estimate the variance
2. Estimate individual random effects

Introduce mathematical notation of multilevel models for a two-level model
Explain technically what it does

> Too technical
* Partition residual variance into between- and within-group (level 2 and level 1) components.
* Allows for un-observables at each level, corrects standard errors: measures of uncertainty
* Micro and macro factors
* richer set of research questions


Various labels:
* Random-effects Models
* Hierarchical Models
* Variance-components Models
* Random-coefficient Models
* Linear / Generalised Linear Mixed Models

## Practice

In R, there are several Packages implementing multilevel models. This tutorial will show how to use the `lme4` Package (short for linear mixed effect models) in R to fit MLM and use the companion `merTools` Package to neatly analyse the model output from `lme4`. This tutorial will cover getting set up and running a few random interpet multilevel models and interpret model estiamtion results.

Recall set the working directory before reading the data.

```{r}
# read data
oa_shp <- st_read("data/mlm/OA.shp")
```

Visualise the hierarchical structure of the data
```{r}
# attach data frame
attach(oa_shp)

# sort data by oa
oa_shp <- oa_shp[order(OA_CD),]
head(oa_shp)
```
**What is the hierarchy of the data?**
